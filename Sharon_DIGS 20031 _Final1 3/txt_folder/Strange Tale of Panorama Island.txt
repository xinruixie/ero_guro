Work on it was supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities as part of a larger research project on the influence of viewing technology on early twentieth-century Japanese literature. I am indebted to the goodwill and critical acumen of many colleagues and friends: Paul Anderer and Kyoko Kurita for carefully reading the entire manuscript and suggesting amendments to the introduction; Kyoto Kurita, Hiromi Morikawa, and Mishizu Ohtake for checking its accuracy; Sanae Eda and Vickie Doll for answering questions about unfamiliar terms; Michiko Ito for assisting with correspondence to Japan; Michele Gerber-Klein for suggesting the fireworks motif for the cover; Pam LeRow for typing repeated changes into the drafts; acquisitions editor Pam Kelley for her skillful management of the project, and manuscript editor Barbara Folsom for her expert interventions.</p>
<p>My deepest and never-ending debt is to my late husband, P. L. M. Gerber, whose love sustained me for many years. This book is for him.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Modern Japanese literature has traditionally been divided between “pure” or high literature, grounded in literary referentiality and “seriousness,” and popular literature, which appeals to more immediate sensory experience and incorporates elements such as mystery, suspense, and dramatic surprise. With the rise of mass culture in the 1920s, this distinction between high literature and popular culture began to blur. The era saw many works by “serious” writers that played upon readers’ love of suspense. Doubles and doppelgängers, visual illusions and deceptions, trickery and crime, and mental derangement and obsessions, brought to effect through the ingenious use of vision technologies, began to appear in stories by well-established writers such as Tanizaki Jun’ichirō, Satō Haruo, Akutagawa Ryūnosuke, Miyazawa Kenji, Uno Kōji, and others.1 Edogawa Ranpo, whose work was heavily influenced by Tanizaki, Satō, and Uno,2 incorporated all of these themes into his stories, and in a way that was more sustained and radical than those of any of his contemporaries.</p>
<p>The modern visual revolution, engendered by the spread of technologies such as advanced astronomical telescopes, microscopes, cameras, panoramas, and motion pictures, introduced viewing perspectives that entailed thrilling new subjective experiences of space and time. In an age of machine production that made exact duplication possible, the public hungered for specular amusements offering optical illusions that looked “exactly” like the real thing.3 The double consciousness of knowing that something was only “play” while enjoying the thrill of the deception was a novelty that urbanites were eager to experience. These entertainments that incorporated illusory experiences reflected the indecipherability of modern city life while offering respite from the tedium of work in surroundings that were often congested, confusing, mechanized, and noisy.</p>
<p>For masses of city dwellers, panoramas and, later, motion pictures in particular, ushered in a whole new level of surrogate experience. Unlike the magic lantern (gentōki),4 which projected images upon a two-dimensional surface viewed in the dark from a stationary position, the panorama drew viewers into a large, circular space and surrounded them on all sides with spectacular paintings whose lifelike nature was enhanced by the natural, indirect sunlight illuminating them from above. Ramps between the viewing platforms and canvases that prevented visitors from going too close to the paintings further ensured their realistic effect. The scale of the painted canvases was enormous, and the impact of their landscapes was made all the more dramatic by the sudden transition into the light from the darkened corridor and staircase through which visitors passed to access the high viewing platforms—passageways that removed them psychologically from the streets outside where they had been walking just minutes before. These “gigantic, movable toys whose mechanism had been stuck”5 enabled average men and women to travel vicariously to exotic places and witness scenes of epoch-making events. Positioned at eye level above the horizon line of the landscapes depicted there, and surveying the landscape with the long horizon in the distance, the observers enjoyed a sense of visual power and control they could never hope to experience while being swallowed up in, distracted and consumed by the busy, noisy, confusing metropolises in which they lived.6</p>
<p>Japan, like the United States and European countries, experienced a panorama boom, although one that was relativity short in duration.7 The first hall housing a panorama in Japan was constructed in Ueno Park in Tokyo at the time of the Third Domestic Industrial Exposition in 1890. Famous battles were a favorite subject of nineteenth-century panoramas, and Japan’s first one treated visitors to scenes of the Boshin War (1868–1869).8 Half a year later, the famous Panorama Hall of Asakusa Park opened in the Sixth Ward of the park in a spot that had once been occupied by a man-made replica of Mount Fuji. The white wooden building with sixteen sides was accessed by means of a dark, subterranean passageway leading to a winding staircase. Thirty-seven meters in diameter and 16 meters tall, with a ridgepole 29 meters high,9 it featured “phantom-like scenes from the Battle of Gettysburg to the accompaniment of a music box”10 and was open all day long continuously throughout the year. With admission fees of ten sen (one-hundredth of a yen) for adults and five sen for children and military personnel, it attracted over a million viewers in a year. The year after it opened, other panorama halls sprang up in Kanda in Tokyo, Namba in Osaka, and Kyoto. Famous Western-style artists such as Koyama Seitarō, Asai Chū, and Yata Torakichi, assisted by huge crews, were engaged to paint grand scenes that stirred martial sentiment. Koyama, for example, directing the work of two hundred painters, completed a painting depicting a scene from the Sino-Japanese War 15 meters tall and 114 meters long in 120 days.11 Like newsreels that later accompanied motion-picture shows, panoramas combined instruction and entertainment and were thus all the more effective as a form of propaganda.</p>
<p>Motion pictures, which entered the country at the turn of the century with the introduction of the Lumière Cinématographe in 1897, brought even more radically different experiences of space. Audiences paid for the novel sensation of sitting in a dark three-dimensional space, looking at a two-dimensional screen illumined to create the illusion of a three-dimensional world. Not only were they simultaneously in two different places—the world of the theater and the world of the film—but the variety of spaces experienced through the eye multiplied at a dizzying pace as the camera moved from angle to angle and segued from long shot to close-up, still shot to pan, and zoom to dissolve. Film editing dramatically increased the number of visual perspectives, breaking up the spatial coherence of the visual field and offering viewers yet more sensations of moving in space. For instance, they could simultaneously experience time in new ways as they were taken backward through flashbacks, or suddenly moved forward, and, through parallel editing, exposed in rapid succession to the juxtaposition of nonchronological moments. Further, through the technology of film, with its ability to present the same actor in different films with different settings at the same time and to distort appearances through camera techniques, the stability of personal identity was rendered more fluid and unpredictable than ever before.12</p>
<p>Edogawa Ranpo (born Hirai Tarō, 1894–1965), known best as the father of the modern Japanese detective novel, responded to and fed the burgeoning interest in the relativity of space and identity more than any other writer of his time. In his stories he played with spaces of different sizes. In his first short work, “The Two-Sen Copper Coin” (Nisen dōka, 1923), he dwelt on the tiny concealing space of the interior of a hollow coin. In his first major work, Strange Tale of Panorama Island (Panoramato kidan, 1926–1927), he played with space as large as an island and toyed with unusual viewing angles. In “The Walker in the Attic” (Yaneura no sanposha, 1925), a man hides himself in the crawl space of the attic of a lodging house and, peering through knotholes to spy on unsuspecting lodgers below, enjoys a vertical perspective that departs from the horizontal plane on which most people conduct their lives. In “A Human Chair” (Ningen isu, 1925) a furniture maker devises a hollow space inside the armchair he is making, inserts himself in the secret space, has himself transported to a hotel lobby, and thrills to the tactile sensation of the bodies of a succession of unsuspecting women who sit on his lap.</p>
<p>Ranpo’s stories that introduced novel perspectives located within unusual spaces also incorporated assorted optical instruments. In “Mirror Hell” (Kagami jigoku, 1926), a man shuts himself up in a sphere whose inside is a continuous convex mirror. In “The Man Traveling with the Brocade Portrait” (Oshie to tabi suru otoko, 1929), a man transports himself to another place and another era through a pair of old-fashioned binoculars. The ultimate use of an enclosed space for the purpose of concealment is the skin of another person, and this Ranpo exploited in stories about stolen identities, such as “The Twins” (Sōseiji, 1924) and Strange Tale of Panorama Island.</p>
<p>In freeing his writings from the dictates of commonsense perceptions of quotidian reality, Edogawa Ranpo, like Tanizaki, Satō, and Uno, frequently employed the themes of the double and the doppelgänger. Some of his characters have double identities. In other instances, men have identical appearances but radically different characters. Typically, one of the pair represents a socially conventional personality while the other embodies a reckless criminal self. Ranpo’s duplicitous doppelgängers share the adroit cunning and brazen nerve of Zigomar, the clever, daring master thief of the immensely popular Zigomar films that Ranpo saw when he was a middle-school student.13 In Strange Tale of Panorama Island, a story of doppelgängers and social deception runs parallel to an obsession with visual illusions inspired by panoramas.</p>
<p>Ranpo wrote for a youthful audience. Most of his stories were published in Shinseinen (New Youth, 1920–1937/1940?–1950), which began as a magazine to educate rural youths with practical articles about how to get along in a modernizing world while entertaining them with adventure and detective stories, many of which were translated from Western languages. Within a few years of its founding, its readership had shifted to urban youths in their late teens and twenties and the magazine had become a “stylish magazine for men” (haikara na menzu magajin) that had the “new sense” (shin-kankaku) “to publish works in the emergent genre of mystery/detective fiction and to report on the latest sociocultural trends for ‘modern boys’ during the late Taishō to early Shōwa eras.”14</p>
<p>Ranpo not only wrote for a young audience but was himself young in his outlook and interests. He loved playacting, illusions, tricks, and surprises. Some critics have traced his taste for the bizarre and the fantastic and his sense of theatrical timing to the visual violence of the misemono (sideshows) that he enjoyed attending as a youth in Nagoya.15 Around the time that he serialized Strange Tale of Panorama Island he wrote about the impact that a misemono depicting the famous sea battle at Port Arthur in Manchuria had had upon him when he was thirteen years old. The daring night attack on Russian ships by a Japanese naval squadron ushered in the Russo-Japanese War, which ended in the defeat and the ultimate collapse of Czarist Russia. It was celebrated throughout Japan for years to come and was the subject of many sideshows, stories, and other entertainments, including the traveling show that Ranpo describes in his 1926 essay, “The Port Arthur Sea Battle Hall” (Ryojun kaisenkan).</p>
<p>The kineorama was a fairly large mechanism for its time. When the curtain opens, the surface of the stage is a giant sea. Blue sky above the horizon line and deep-blue undulating water beneath it. The kineorama lights create the illusion of waves moving on the sea. A high whistle blows and a sailor delivers a brief introduction. Then from one side of the stage a squadron of ships, led by the flagship the Mikasa, advances boldly, parting the waves. A fluttering Rising Sun flag, puffs of black smoke rising into the air, toy warships on the panorama-like stage—as I look it all seems real.</p>
<p>Then a squadron of enemy ships appears from the opposite side. Slowly in the beginning and gradually more violently, the artillery duel is begun. The sound of gunfire assaults the ears. White smoke blankets the sea. Spray. Enemy ships on fire. Sinking ships.</p>
<p>After that comes the night battle scene. The moon appears. The kineorama creates the illusion of clouds passing in front of the moon. Lights on the ship gunwales go on. A beacon shines. It reflects on the water and rolling waves gleam. Each time the cannon is fired streaks of red sparks appear. The beauty of the ships on fire.</p>
<p>That was all there was to the show, but I was enchanted by it.16</p>
<p>Delighted by the spectacle, the next day Ranpo set about reenacting the sea battle with his friends. In his four-and-half-mat tatami room, they improvised a small stage a tenth of the size of the original. They assembled fluttering strips of cloth to represent waves, toy ships, a toy pistol for the sound of the ships’ cannons, a flashlight for the moonlight, and cotton balls soaked in alcohol to produce the ships’ fires. Small neighborhood children were invited to view the show, for which they provided resounding sound effects from behind a black curtain. Ranpo concludes the description by saying that, even now, he would like to try making such toys again and that the tendency to enjoy play of that sort was an inborn trait of his, one that he had indulged in many times since he was a small child.</p>
<p>And indeed, a taste for playacting and theater animates his stories. They are often presented as if on a stage, with a dramatic buildup leading to a surprise ending that is presented abruptly, as if to the clatter of wooden stage clappers signaling the finale of a show. Endings are sometimes gory, like those of the misemono that Ranpo saw as a child. He recalls one such show that featured the dismemberment of a person who had been struck by a train. “A neck, a torso, hands and feet tumbling like potatoes or giant radishes, and copious amounts of blood flowing from cuts were displayed so realistically as to make one want to throw up.”17</p>
<p>In the same essay, Ranpo also describes the panorama mise-mono that fascinated him when he was a child:</p>
<p>A building resembling an oil tank suddenly rising into the sky could not but arouse the curiosity of a child. A narrow entryway. A dark, narrow tunnel-like passage. And when you pass through it, suddenly a universe looking absolutely real and completely unlike any you have ever seen before opens up from the sky to the horizon line. It’s an incredibly marvelous trick. I recently read in a book an account of the labors of the panorama’s inventor. He designed that invention from a desire to create a universe exactly the way he wanted it in a round, enclosed building. His plan to double the world is really interesting. Because the background is circular, there is no end to the horizon line painted on it. The sky is blocked by the canopy over the spectators’ seats, and the sunlight shines on it from above, producing a feeling of infinity. It creates the illusion of an actual wide world inside a small circle. Outside that small enclosed world is another, real world. It’s a fairy tale brought to life.18</p>
<p>In the essay “One More World” (Ima hitotsu no sekai, 1926) Ranpo reiterates his fascination with the way in which a universe can be created within the confines of a single building through the illusion made possible by an unbroken, circular background and a ceiling that conceals the sky but admits sunlight from above. He expresses delight with the paradox of two worlds existing simultaneously in the same place, at once both inside and outside the building. He concludes the essay by referring to his view of art as “panoramism” (panoramashugi) and saying that his dream was to create on paper with words a panorama, a real other world.19</p>
<p>The desire to escape the tedium and monotony of everyday life and flee to an alternative world is a recurring theme in Ranpo’s essays and stories. He posits this impulse as a fundamental desire that exists widely in modern Japan. Children escape by reading fairy tales. Youths seek escape through adventure tales. Adults find respite from the enervation of the everyday routine in geisha parties, theater, music, painting, and novels. For scholars, scientific and historical discoveries that engage the imagination transport them to other realms. Creators of utopias and philosophers and religious thinkers are also in quest of alternative worlds. Ranpo confesses that he has attempted to fulfill his lifelong desire to create another world in the clumsy execution of stories describing life in the interior of an attic and from the inside of a chair—efforts that he disparages as “next to comic failures.”20 His first long work would be far more successful.</p>
<p>When Ranpo began serializing Panoramato kidan in Shinseinen in October 1926, public interest in Manchuria was high. Images of its vast plains filled the media of movie screens, magazines, and newspapers, beckoning readers to a continent that was being turned into a panoramic spectacle in the popular imagination.21 Ranpo, in his novella, transformed the expansionist vision of Manchuria into a literal panorama spectacle, complete with a “gory battle frightening to behold.” As few other Japanese writers managed to do, he conveyed the way in which mechanized visions of the twentieth century fed dreams of greatness, and how those dreams might lead to destruction and death. Foremost of those technologies of vision to which he was exposed as a youth and by which he was inspired as a writer were panoramas.</p>
<p>A panorama, which by 1916 was a faintly anachronistic viewing device, having been surpassed in popularity by the motion picture, serves as a model for realizing the other world of which the protagonist of Strange Tale of Panorama Island dreams. A remote island is transformed into a giant panorama with a tower in the middle that provides a commanding view of the entire island. Access to the island is through an underwater passageway akin to the dark passageway leading to a panorama. A glass tunnel fitted with electric lamps functions as a lens that magnifies and distorts the appearance of strange, phosphorescent fish and sea plants at the bottom of the sea. The voluptuous underwater phantasmagoria in which naked women swim past the glass echoes the visual fantasies of early twentieth-century film productions such as Georges Méliès’ 1907 Under the Seas, an adaptation of Jules Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea, in which mermaids create arabesques with upraised arms and coiled tails against a cavernous recession covered with lily pads.</p>
<p>The underwater tunnel ends in a staircase that the travelers ascend to reach the lighted area, and they step out of the darkness and into the dazzling daylight to behold a vista of breathtaking beauty. Panoramas are carefully constructed to create a sense of hyper-reality, and Ranpo’s panorama island is filled with cleverly designed optical illusions. Staircases are made to appear longer than they actually are by making their top ends narrow. Trick scenery induces one to think that one is climbing when one is actually descending, to think that one is moving forward when one is actually returning to the starting point. Low land changes suddenly into a mountaintop. A wide plain is unexpectedly transformed into a narrow path. An undulating horizon line produces strange, erotic sensations in the travelers who walk through the landscape. Nothing in this landscape is ordinary, predictable, or boring.</p>
<p>The scenes on the island that greet visitors are as amazing as the fantastical sets of the motion-picture extravaganzas of the day. A staircase rises into the sky. White-feathered “birds” speak in women’s voices and offer to serve as vehicles. Clusters of naked men and women romp on slopes carpeted with rainbow-colored flowers. Women lolling on tree branches dangle their limbs in time to sensual music filling the air. The naked bodies dancing and reclining in the open fields evoke the motif of the Arcadian garden found in early twentieth-century painting such as Matisse’s dreamlike, mythical landscape Bonheur de vivre (1906). The wildly churning mechanisms in the panorama of machines, on the other hand, predate by some thirty years the meta-mechanic motion sculptures of the Swiss avant-garde artist Jean Tinguely, who parodied the meaninglessness and absurdity of the overly mechanized environment of modern life in his iron assemblages with erratically moving parts.22</p>
<p>The unnatural perfection of the spectacular ravines, cliffs, and woods with not a leaf out of place has a literary precedent in Poe’s “The Domain of Arnheim” (1847). Like Ranpo’s island, Poe’s is an artificial landscape designed by a creative genius who inherits a massive fortune and grasps the opportunity to realize a fantasy landscape, using elements of nature to create it on land the way an artist uses paint to give shape to his vision on canvas. On Poe’s perfectly constructed island, as on Ranpo’s, the visitor is “enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The thought of nature still remained, but her character seemed to have undergone modification; there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety in these her works. Not a dead branch—not a withered leaf—not a stray pebble—not a patch of brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystal water welled up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.”23 Travelers are transported over water in mysterious vehicles in both works: swan boats that are actually women disguised as water birds in Ranpo’s and, in Poe’s, a crescent-shaped canoe of ivory that “lies on the surface of the bay with the proud grace of a swan.”</p>
<p>The spectacle awaiting the visitors to Ranpo’s panorama island is wrapped in an atmosphere as mysterious and imposing as that which greets the fairy boat of Arnheim as it “glides magically into a winding channel and slips between two gates and commences a rapid descent into a huge amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple mountains, whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit.”</p>
<p>Like Poe’s Arnheim, too, Ranpo’s utopia is filled with “entrancing” music and redolent with a “strange, sweet odor.”</p>
<p>In addition to mystery and fantasy, Ranpo’s writing, particularly in the early period, is filled with elements of humor and play. This aspect of his creativity is often overlooked. (Shinseinen magazine, in which he published many of his stories, also offered its young readers many humorous stories by Western authors such as P. G. Wodehouse and Stephen Leacock.) Ranpo’s style of play often manifested itself in irony. It is notable in the beginning of Strange Tale of Panorama Island, where the mysterious island is introduced through the eyes and ears of the local inhabitants. The opening is reminiscent of Uno Kōji’s “Two Aoki Aisaburōs,” in which an insignificant, isolated spot far from the nation’s capital becomes the site of outrageous deceptions. A faint note of sardonic humor underlies the quiet, prescient tone that prevails in the initial description of the small, uninhabited island, which “floats like a green manjū [sweet bean-jam bun] turned upside down,” where I Bay juts out into the Pacific Ocean. The scene is notably unremarkable; “practically no one takes note of the island save for occasional fishermen who go ashore on a whim.” But in this remote setting, events of unimaginable, incredible excess will soon unfold. The first sign of disruption in the ordinary, uneventful world of the poor fishing villages comes with rumors of strange construction taking place on the island—rumors that grow more “fairy-tale like” as one moves farther away from the location. For instance, Ranpo’s narrator teasingly withholds the explanation of what it was that prevented the completion of the large concrete pillar in the center of the artificially landscaped island.</p>
<p>His humor darkens as the measures the protagonist takes to carry out his scheme of impersonating his former classmate grow increasingly more outlandish and bizarre. In the scene where he fakes his suicide by jumping off a boat, Hirosuke crawls to the edge of the deck and climbs over the railing “like an enormous lizard.” In a ghoulish cemetery scene that comes across as more laughable than horrific, he feels “like the old granny of a penny-candy store trying to catch pieces of jelly floating in water,” as he lifts the dead body out of the grave and struggles with the fine skin of the corpse, which clings to his palms “like gloves made of jellyfish” that won’t come off no matter how vigorously he shakes his hands. The humor reaches a climax in the buffoonish scene in which Hirosuke wraps himself in a sheet and lies down in bushes by the roadside, to be discovered by a group of sniveling, runny-nosed peasant children who scream upon seeing “his lunatic figure in a shroud.”</p>
<p>The tension between the horrifying and the laughable—a hallmark of the grotesque imagination—is fully on display in the animal imagery of the penultimate chapter, in which a man and a woman are locked in a death struggle under a dark sky lit by brilliantly exploding fireworks. The woman is described as “displaying her fangs like a gorilla” and “sinking her sharp canines deep into his arm.” Struggling in the mud, the nude couple “are stuck together like sea slugs.” The man closes in on her “like a cat,” and she breaks away from his grip and plunges into the water with the “vigor of a seal.”</p>
<p>Ranpo’s ludic tastes were also evident in his manipulation of proper names. The writer who devised for himself a pen name that plays on the syllables “Edgar Allen Poe” liked to insert word puzzles into his stories. In Strange Tale of Panorama Island the main character, an impecunious student with poor eyesight who is given to daydreaming, is named “Hitomi,” written with the graphs for “person” (hito) and “see” (mi). This name, which is also the Japanese word for “eye pupil,” calls attention to the primacy of the visual sense, which dominates the story from beginning to end. Hitomi’s first name, “Hirosuke,” written with the graph for “wide” (hiro), hints at the breadth of vision of the panorama. His full name is a play on the idea of “Pan-orama” (literally, “all horama,” or “entire view”).</p>
<p>Hitomi’s great venture relies upon a visual deception, the fact that he looks exactly like his former wealthy classmate, Komoda, whose identity he usurps in order to gain access to the Komoda family fortune that will enable him to construct the island of his dreams. The word for “came” (kita) and the word for “see” (mi) appear in the name “Kitami,” the detective who comes to the island toward the end of the story and uncovers Hitomi’s true identity. Kitami’s first name, Kogoro, written with the graph for “small” (ko), offsets the graph for “wide” in Hirosuke’s name. In contrast to Hitomi’s project to construct a panorama-like island, a huge undertaking entailing the labors of hundreds of workers, Kitami’s act that leads to the collapse of Hitomi’s project is tiny. It consists of catching sight of a single hair sticking out from the concrete pillar that rises in the center of the island. Kitami had also discovered the key to Hitomi’s scheme in the unpublished manuscript of the novel that Hitomi wrote while he was a university student. In a series of reflections, the utopia in Hitomi’s novel is mirrored in Hitomi’s project; and the RA in the title of the novel, “The Story of RA,” reflects the RA in RAnpo’s own nom de plume. Kitami, who was the editor of the school magazine that rejected Hitomi’s manuscript, ironically turns out to be Hitomi’s “ideal reader”—attentive and alert to every authorial gesture.24</p>
<p>Ranpo wrote in an era before television, the Internet, and cell phones created an environment in which events are made instantly visible and constant disclosure and demystification are staples of public discourse. It was a more leisurely age, when life moved at a slower pace and people had more leeway to imagine and dream about the possibilities of other worlds. Japanese readers who grew up in the 1920s recall the anticipation of returning home from school and reading the stories of Edogawa Ranpo, which transported them to peculiar imaginary spaces. His great appeal to readers resided in the depth of his desire to transcend the utilitarian, bureaucratic rationalism of modern society that relegated people to predetermined lives. At a time of anxiety created by economic depression, mass migration into the cities, colonial expansion, and political upheaval, Ranpo’s stories dealt with the fearsomeness of the unfamiliar by giving it shape and containing it in entertaining ludic forms. Readers and audiences of those years of “ero guro nansensu” (erotic, grotesque nonsense) were drawn to his strange dreams and violent fantasies that were, after all, only play.25</p>
<p>Significantly, Ranpo also succeeded in creating a new literature that moved the reader’s imagination beyond the printed word and into the freer, image-based realm of the media.26 His first major work has proven to be remarkably prescient in its references to kinds of technologies that did not exist when he wrote.27 Today, when IMAX theaters envelop viewers in simulated landscapes, sea worlds enable visitors to experience the ocean from the vantage point of the bottom of the sea, and robots and autonomous machines are transforming the way in which humans live, his visionary stories are being rediscovered by another generation of readers and taking on new relevance as they continue to fascinate and delight youthful dreamers.</p>
<p>Strange Tale of Panorama Island</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Few residents of M Prefecture may know of its existence. Located at the southernmost point of S County in M Prefecture, the island measures scarcely five miles in diameter and floats like a green manjū turned upside down, far from the other islands where I Bay opens out into the Pacific Ocean. It’s deserted nowadays. Nobody takes note of it, save for occasional fishermen who go ashore there on a whim. It stands alone in the wild sea at the tip of the cape, and unless the sea is calm, it’s risky for small fishing boats to approach it. What’s more, it’s hardly a place that one would hazard danger to go near.</p>
<p>The local people call it Okinoshima, the Island of the Offing. At some point the entire island became the property of the Komoda family of T City, the richest family in all of M Prefecture.1 In the past, a group of fishermen who worked for the Komodas had taken it upon themselves to build a small hut on the island to use for drying nets and storing things. But it was all cleared away when strange work suddenly began on the island several years ago. Dozens of construction workers and gardeners transported on specially outfitted motorboats came to the island day after day.</p>
<p>Huge rocks of various shapes, trees, steel frames, lumber, and countless barrels of concrete were transported to the island from somewhere. And a huge undertaking that involved construction work and gardening began, far from human habitation, on the rough sea, for reasons unknown.</p>
<p>On the coast facing the island, there were only poor fishing villages, fewer than a hundred households in all, scattered here and there among towering, impassable cliffs. There was no government railroad, of course, and no narrow-gauge, private railroad. In those days there weren’t even buses. Since it was such a completely out-of-the-way place, cut off from so-called civilization, even though strange work began on the island, rumors of it just passed from village to village, and as one got farther away one from it, the more fairy-tale–like the stories became, so that even if word of it were to circulate in a neighboring town, at most it would be mentioned on the gossip page of a local newspaper and that would be the end of it. But if it had occurred near a city, it surely would have created quite a “sensation,” so strange was the operation.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the local fishermen could not help being suspicious. Why all that digging of earth, planting of trees, construction of walls, and building of houses with no care for expense on that island where people never went? It was unlikely that members of the Komoda family had taken a fancy to live on that inconvenient island, and to create a park in such a place would be strange as well. It was rumored that the head of the Komoda family may have been mad.</p>
<p>There was a reason for this. The present head of the Komoda family had epilepsy. It worsened and then, a little while ago, his death was announced and a splendid funeral was held that became the talk of the area. But, strangely enough, he came back to life, and it was rumored among the local fisherfolk that after he came back to life his personality had changed completely. He was often irrational and at times acted crazily, and they suspected that the construction work was related to it.</p>
<p>At any rate, this mysterious undertaking, which aroused the suspicion of the local folk but hardly reached the ears of the city dwellers, progressed steadily under the direct instruction of the current head of the Komoda family. In three or four months, a strange earthen wall like the Great Wall of China encompassed the entire island. Inside it were ponds and rivers, and hills and valleys, and in the middle, a strange, huge, iron-framed concrete structure.</p>
<p>I believe I will have an opportunity later on to tell you about how extraordinarily strange and magnificent that sight was. So I won’t talk about it now. A thoughtful person who sees Okinoshima in its present ruined state may be able to imagine how fantastic the completed project would have been. Alas, when it was almost completed it was brought to a standstill by an unforeseen event.</p>
<p>As for why the project was abandoned, only a few people really know what happened. Why is that? It’s because the whole thing was carried out in secret. The purpose and nature of the undertaking, and the reason for its termination, were all buried in ambiguity. The only known facts are that around the time of the setback of the operation, both the head of the Komoda house and his wife left this world, and unfortunately, because they had no children, the inheritance went to relatives. It’s not that there weren’t rumors about the cause of their deaths, but they were just rumors, and because they couldn’t be verified, the deaths did not attract the attention of the authorities.</p>
<p>Even after that, the island remained in the Komoda family, but the enterprise was abandoned, there were no visitors, and it was neglected. The man-made forest, groves, and flower gardens lost their original forms, weeds ran rampant, and the strange, large, round, ferro-concrete pillar was exposed to the wind and rain and fell apart. The trees, shrubs, rocks, and timber that had been transported there at great expense would cost even more to send back to the capital and sell, so they were left standing just where they were as they fell into ruin. And so, even today, if you readers were to put up with the inconvenience of a journey and visit the southern border of M Prefecture, and cross the rough sea and go ashore at Okinoshima, you’d surely be able to discover the remains of a strange man-made landscape there.</p>
<p>At first glance, it’s nothing but an extremely large garden, but some people can’t help but sense that it must have been a fantastic sort of project or some kind of fabulous work of art. At the same time they can’t help being overcome by the sense of a lingering baleful spirit, a ghastly shuddering presence emanating from that place.</p>
<p>Actually, there’s an almost unbelievable story connected to the place. Part of the story has become an open secret among persons associated with the Komoda family; and an essential part of the story is an even stranger story known to just two persons. If you readers would be so kind as to lend credence to what I have to say, and listen to this story till the very end, as preposterous as it may seem … then I will begin the secret tale.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The story begins in Tokyo, far from M Prefecture.</p>
<p>In a student quarter located in the central district of the city, there was a typically squalid lodging house called the “Friendship House.” And in its shabbiest room dwelled a strange young man by the name of Hirosuke Hitomi. It wasn’t clear if he was a student or a vagrant, but he looked over thirty years old. He had graduated from a private university over ten years before construction work on Okinoshima began. He didn’t seek employment after graduation, and had no source of income, so he sponged off friends and begged his way into lodging houses, and in the end he drifted into the “Friendship House,” where he was staying up until the year before the work began.</p>
<p>He called himself a student of philosophy, but he didn’t necessarily attend philosophy lectures. At one time he took a fancy to literature, and his addiction to it led him to hunt for books in that field; but then he took off in a completely different direction and zealously audited classes in the architecture division. On another occasion he poked his nose into the study of sociology and economics. Then the next time he bought up oil painting gear and played at painting. He had such varied tastes and tired of things so quickly that he acquired knowledge in no one field, to the point where one marveled at how he had been able to graduate from school at all. And when he studied something, it was invariably not the orthodox teaching but one that was strangely one-sided and heretical. So even though ten years had passed since he finished his formal studies, he was still idle and unable to get a job.</p>
<p>Hirosuke Hitomi didn’t subscribe to the tame notion that a job could help one lead an ordinary life. In truth, he was fed up with this world before he had experienced it. It may have been due to the inborn weakness of his constitution, or perhaps to the neurasthenia from which he had suffered since adolescence. He couldn’t bring himself to do anything. He was satisfied to live life on the level of his imagination. Nothing was truly important. He lay about in the dirty lodging house all year round lost in daydreams of a kind that practical men never experience. In other words, he was nothing but an inveterate dreamer.</p>
<p>Well then, you may wonder, what on earth was he dreaming about when he cast off all the things of this world? Well, he was dreaming up detailed plans for his own ideal place, his utopia.</p>
<p>From the time he was in school he had been an unusually avid reader of dozens of idealistic and utopian works from Plato’s onward.1 He found an echo of his own feelings in their writings and was able to comfort himself by imagining the feelings of the authors of those different works, who consoled themselves by entrusting to words the dreams that they could not realize.</p>
<p>He was almost completely indifferent to political or economic utopias. What captured his heart was the utopia of a land of dream and beauty, a true terrestrial paradise. That’s why he preferred Morris’ “From Utopia”2 to Cabet’s “Voyage to Ikaria”;3 but more than Morris it was “The Land of Arnheim”4 by Edgar Allan Poe that attracted him the most.</p>
<p>His one outstanding dream was to create a huge work of art using nature itself, its mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees as his materials. As the musician uses musical instruments, and the painter uses canvas and paints, and the poet uses words, he would use living things as his materials—rocks, trees, flowers, birds flying over them, animals, even insects—all had life and he would use them as his materials as they lived and grew, hour by hour, second by second. Not satisfied with nature as made by God, he would change it as he liked according to his own individuality, he would beautify it and in so doing express his unique artistic ideals. In other words, he himself would become God and remake nature.</p>
<p>Art, according to him, was the revolt of humans against nature. It was none other than the expression of a human being’s dissatisfaction with the way things are and his desire to imprint his own individual personality upon nature. The musician, for example, dissatisfied with the voice of the wind, the roaring of the waves, and the cries of birds and beasts as they are, makes an effort to create his own sounds. The job of the painter is not to strictly reproduce nature as it is but to change and beautify it according to his own personality. As for the poet, needless to say, he is far from being a reporter or a chronicler of banal reality.</p>
<p>But why, then, are these so-called artists satisfied to rely simply on indirect, ineffective, and difficult means such as musical instruments, paints, and words? Why do they not look at nature itself? Why don’t they make direct use of nature as their musical instruments, or pigments, or words? As proof that it is not completely impossible to do, do not landscape gardeners and architects actually use nature to a certain extent, changing and beautifying it? Could one not do it on an even more artistic, grander scale, Hirosuke Hitomi wondered.</p>
<p>Accordingly, more than the various tales of utopia that I mentioned earlier, more than their imaginary play with words, he was drawn many times more to something more real—the magnificent works of the emperors of old, above all of the tyrants, in which his own ideals were realized to a certain extent. For example, the pyramids and the Sphinx of Egypt, and the great citadels and religious cities of Greece and Rome, and, in China, the Great Wall and the Epang Palace,5 and, in Japan, the great Buddhist buildings erected since the Asuka era6 and the Golden Pavilion and the Silver Pavilion.7 And it was not just their architecture; Hirosuke Hitomi’s heart leapt up when he imagined the utopian thoughts of the heroes who had created these works.</p>
<p>Hirosuke Hitomi often sighed with longing thinking about the the title of a book by an utopian writer, If I Were Given an Immense Fortune.</p>
<p>“If I were able to get a hold of a huge sum of money, more than I could spend in a lifetime, I’d first of all buy up a huge plot of land, no matter where, and I’d employ a few hundred, a few thousand workers if needed to build the paradise on earth, the land of beauty I’ve always dreamt about.”</p>
<p>When he began daydreaming, he would go on endlessly and could not rest until he had worked out every detail of his utopia in his head. But he woke up to the fact that what he had created in his head was a mere daydream, nothing more than a castle in the sky, and that he was actually nothing but a poor student, pathetic to behold, having trouble just feeding himself day by day. And given his skills, even if he were to sacrifice his life and work with all his strength and all his might, when he had finished working it seemed that he would not even be able to raise several tens of thousands yen.</p>
<p>He was but a dreamer. While intoxicated by dreams of unattainable beauty, he had to spend every day of his actual life leading a dreary existence in a four-and-a-half-mat room in a dirty lodging house. What a pathetic contrast! Anyone else would have turned to art and found therein consolation at least, but through fate, although he had artistic tendencies, apart from his dreams no art had the power to attract him, nor was he blessed with a talent for it.</p>
<p>Of course, if he were able to actualize his dream, there’s no doubt but that it would be a truly unprecedented, huge undertaking, a great work of art. That’s why it is really not surprising that, wandering in this world of dreams, he was indifferent to any kind of social undertaking and that any kind of entertainment, and even any kind of art, appeared utterly worthless to him.</p>
<p>Although he had lost his interest in all things, he had to work somewhat, were it only to eat. Since leaving school, he had barely raised enough for his daily needs by subcontracting translation assignments, writing nursery tales, and, once in a while, by writing an adult novel and taking it to various magazine editors.</p>
<p>In the beginning, he had some interest in art, and was able to discover not a little solace in publishing his dreams in the form of stories in the manner of the utopian writers of yore, and he did this with some passion for a time. But the things he wrote, aside from the translations, were not well received by the magazine companies. One would have to say that this was to be expected, because they were extremely dull, self-indulgent works in which he merely described his utopia in minutest detail, using various styles.</p>
<p>For this reason, his works, although elaborately worked over with care, were regularly rejected by the magazine editors. His character was too proud to be satisfied to just play around with words, and so he never had much success as a writer. But if he were to quit, he’d at once have trouble meeting his daily expenses, so, hateful as it was, he had no choice but to continue his life as a low-rank hack writer.</p>
<p>He produced his manuscripts, which he sold for fifty sen a page, and in his spare time he worked on his plan to create a utopia. He filled page after page with his plans for buildings and tore them up one after the other, while in his heart envying the emperors of ancient times who had been able to realize their dreams as he wished to realize his own.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Well now, to return to the story. Hirosuke Hitomi was leading this purposeless, humdrum existence day by day when of a sudden, about a year before the works on the island that I mentioned before began, a wonderful piece of luck came about that marks the beginning of this story.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary circumstance, which cannot be summed up in the words “good fortune.” It was for him awesome and frightening, but also enchanting and fascinating, like a fairy tale. When he heard the good (?) news, he remembered something, and then experienced a strange joy that he had never felt before, and in the next instant his teeth chattered at the fearsomeness of the idea that came to him.</p>
<p>It was a journalist, an old classmate from his university days whom he hadn’t seen for some time, who gave him the information. He had come to pay him a visit, and as he was talking, he announced without any afterthought:</p>
<p>“By the way, you most probably don’t know it yet, but your older brother just died two or three days ago.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Hirosuke Hitomi could not help exclaiming at this strange statement.</p>
<p>“Have you already forgotten your famous other half? Your twin brother, Genzaburō Komoda.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Komoda, Komoda the millionaire? You really startled me. But what on earth did he die of?”</p>
<p>“We received a communication from our correspondent. Apparently he died of the epilepsy that he had. He had an attack and never recovered. He wasn’t even forty years old. It was tragic.”</p>
<p>A bit later the journalist added:</p>
<p>“What amazed me even more was how alike the two of you look. The note was sent together with a recent photo of Komoda, and when I saw it, it seemed to me that you looked more alike than you did five or six years ago when we were at the university. Cover up his moustache and put your eyeglasses on him, and it’s you to a T.”</p>
<p>From this conversation, you readers understand that the poor student Hirosuke Hitomi and Genzaburō Komoda, the wealthiest man in M Prefecture, had been classmates at the university and strangely enough looked so alike that the other students nicknamed them “the twins.” Their faces had the same shapes; they had the same physiques and even the same voices. They were exactly like two peas in a pod. But because of the difference in their ages, their fellow classmates teased them by calling Genzaburō Komoda the older brother twin and Hirosuke Hitomi the younger brother.</p>
<p>While they were teased, they themselves had to acknowledge that the nickname was not misplaced. Indeed, for two who were not twins to resemble each other so closely that they were mistaken for twins was a bit unusual. And when one thinks about the strange, shocking incident that this resemblance later gave birth to, one cannot but shudder at the fearsomeness of fate.</p>
<p>Neither of the twins showed up in class often, and they were seldom in the same place. And yet, even if they were to be seen together, one could easily tell one from the other, because Hirosuke always wore glasses on account of his nearsightedness and could thus be distinguished even from a distance. They had, by and large, gotten by without occasioning any gossip, although in the course of student life their extraordinary resemblance had once or twice led to incidents about which the other students made jokes.</p>
<p>The news of his twin’s death startled Hirosuke Hitomi more than if it had been just another fellow student. But he had such a dislike of Komoda, this shadow of himself, because they looked so much alike, that he didn’t feel any particular sadness. Even so, Hirosuke Hitomi was surprised by the news. More surprised than saddened. And more than surprise, it was a strange, uncanny presentiment that he felt.</p>
<p>But it took him a while to realize this. The journalist went on talking at length about this and that, and it wasn’t until he had left and Hirosuke was alone and thinking about Komoda’s death that monstrous imaginings rose up in his head with the rapidity and ominousness of a spreading evening rain cloud.</p>
<p>He turned pale, clenched his teeth, and began to shake as he sat still in one spot for a long time, and in that position he stared at an idea that was gradually taking shape in his mind. In fear, he tried to hold back the insane idea that seethed in his mind, but the harder he tried to suppress it the brighter the scenes of the evil scheme became, succeeding each other with the brilliance of a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>One of the main things leading him to think up such an unheard-of evil scheme was the fact that in M Prefecture, where the Komodas lived, cremation was generally not practiced. Members of the upper classes like the Komoda family were particularly averse to cremation and buried their dead instead. He knew this well, having heard about it from Komoda himself during their student days. The other reason was that Komoda had died during an epileptic fit. That also called forth certain memories.</p>
<p>Hirosuke Hitomi, happily or unhappily, had previously been addicted to reading books on death by Hartmann,1 Bouchut,2 and Kempner.3 Since he had a fair amount of knowledge, in particular about burials of people who only seemed to be dead, he was well aware that death by epilepsy was by no means certain and could lead to the interment of a still living being. Most of you readers have undoubtedly read the short story by Edgar Allan Poe entitled “A Premature Burial.”4 And you are fully aware of the fear of being buried alive.</p>
<p>“Live burial” is without doubt the most frightening among the fates of extreme misfortune into which human beings have fallen (including the Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre and other horrible historical events). Thinking human beings cannot deny that these things happen all too often in our world. The boundary dividing death and life is often barely distinguishable. Who can determine where life ends and where death begins? It happens that in certain diseases the visible organs of life stop functioning altogether, but these cessations are just temporary, no more than an inexplicable, momentary arrest of vital function. Then, after a while (sometimes it’s a matter of hours, sometimes of days, or of weeks), an extraordinary, invisible power starts to work and the small cogwheels and large cogwheels begin moving again, like magic.</p>
<p>That epilepsy is one of those diseases is known without a doubt from the real-life examples cited in various books. For some reason he clearly remembered from his reading of a publication of the American “Association for the Prevention of Live Burial” that a section on epilepsy was included among diseases that easily give rise to temporary death.</p>
<p>When he read about innumerable, actual examples of live burial he was stuck by a strange feeling so extraordinary that the words “fear” or “trembling” are too ordinary and commonplace to describe it. For example, burned into his memory forever were the impressions of the story about a pregnant woman who was buried prematurely and then came back to life in the grave, and not only came back to life but gave birth to a baby in the darkness, and died in agony holding the crying baby in her arms (she probably even placed her dry breast into the mouth of the baby covered in blood).</p>
<p>But why did he remember so clearly that epilepsy was a disease accompanied by such a risk? Hirosuke Hitomi himself was not aware of it, and in fact that is what is so frightening about the human heart, but while reading those works, he had unconsciously thought of Komoda the millionaire, his look-alike, the one who was called his identical twin and was epileptic. Hirosuke Hitomi, who was a dreamer by nature, as I said earlier, he who ceaselessly toyed with ideas, could not but have taken note of it, even if he was not fully conscious of it.</p>
<p>Assuming that were so, one cannot help thinking that the seed that was secretly planted in his heart some years before started to germinate at the news of Komoda’s death. At any rate, that day he sat up all night, unable to lie down. He felt the cold sweat oozing out of his whole body as a terrifying scheme took shape, step by step, in his mind. What in the beginning seemed nothing but a fairy tale or a dream little by little began to take on the color of reality and in the end seemed like a completely normal thing, something that would succeed without fail if he just put his hand to it.</p>
<p>“It’s idiotic. No matter how much that guy and you might look alike … such a crazy … really crazy thing … has anyone since the beginning of humanity ever come up with such an idiotic idea? In detective stories one often reads about instances of one twin taking the place of the other and playing two roles at the same time, but that doesn’t happen in the real world. But isn’t the evil plan that you’re in the process of elaborating the fruit of a crazy imagination? Let’s not lose any time with this nonsense. Keep your place and be satisfied to just dream of your utopia that cannot be realized in your lifetime.”</p>
<p>Thus he tried many times to shake off the frightful fantasy that was in the process of taking over his mind. But soon thereafter he continued.</p>
<p>“But when you think about it, a project so simple and risk-free is not such a rare thing. Even if you have to go to great lengths and face all sorts of danger, if you were to somehow succeed, you’d be able to get your hands on the capital for your utopia which you’ve dreamt about for so long and want so badly. Think of the pleasure and the joy! One way or the other, you’re tired of this world and sick of this life that goes nowhere. Even if you should lose your life, what’s there to regret? In reality you’d be doing nothing wrong. You wouldn’t be killing anyone, and it’s not as though you’d be committing an awful deed that would harm society. All you’d have to do is cleverly erase your own existence and take on the role of Genzaburō Komoda.</p>
<p>“And what will you do? You’ll make a work of nature, a landscape creation, a stupendous work of art that no one since ancient times has ever tried to realize. You’ll create a paradise, a heaven on this earth! What do you have to be ashamed of? And the Komoda family will recover the household head who was thought to have died; they’ll be overjoyed and will have nothing to reproach you with. You may think that it’s a great crime, yet if you examine the results one at a time, wouldn’t it be a good deed rather than an evil one?”</p>
<p>Seen from this point of view, his reasoning was indeed logical. And if there were no obstacles to its execution, one might say that his scheme held practically nothing that could have pricked his conscience.</p>
<p>More than anything else, what made the realization of his project easy was the fact that Genzaburō Komoda’s parents had died a long time ago and his family was composed solely of his young wife and some servants. Granted, he also had a younger sister married to a nobleman in Tokyo, and in the provinces there were probably many kinfolk, given that he came from such a prominent family. But they could not be expected to know that there was a man named Hirosuke Hitomi who looked just like the deceased Genzaburō, and even if they had somehow heard a rumor about him, they surely couldn’t imagine that he resembled him so closely, and there was no reason why they would even dream that the man would turn up as Genzaburō’s double.</p>
<p>And on top of it, it happened by chance that he also had an innate gift for the theater. The only thing to be frightened of was Genzaburō’s wife, who must know Genzaburō’s idiosyncrasies down to the last minute detail. But as long as he kept this clearly in mind and avoided as much as possible engaging in intimate man-and-wife conversations with her, she would probably not notice. Moreover, because a dead person had come back to life, she wouldn’t be so suspicious about the fact that his appearance and character had changed a little, and would think that he was acting like that on account of the unusual circumstances of his recovery.</p>
<p>In this way, as he got more and more involved in thinking about the details of the plot and weighing the particulars of the situation, little by little his great plan appeared to increase in reality and possibility. The remaining problems posed without question the greatest difficulty, and that was how he was going to eradicate himself, and how he would arrange the resurrection of Komoda so that it seemed real, and how he would handle the corpse of the real Komoda.</p>
<p>He must have been cunning by nature to be able to plan this kind of large-scale crime (no matter how he justified it to himself), and as he continued to focus tenaciously in this manner, he managed to easily solve the most difficult part.</p>
<p>And after he had decided that it was good, he again went over and rethought what he had planned down to the smallest detail; and in the end, after he had looked at it from all angles without leaving any gaps, there came the moment when he had to make the big decision of whether or not to actually execute the plan.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Feeling as if all the blood in his body had collected in his head, he forgot all about the frightening aspects of the scheme he had been thinking of. Having spent days and nights thinking about his plan and refining it, he decided to put it into action.</p>
<p>When he recalled it later, he would realize that his feeling at the time was akin to sleepwalking, and that though he was about to carry out his plan, he felt strangely empty, as if that great plan were some casual pleasure trip that he was setting out on. But somewhere in a corner of his mind lurked the consciousness that what he was doing was actually a dream and that there was another real world waiting for him on the other side of the dream.</p>
<p>As I said before, his plan was divided into two crucial parts.</p>
<p>The first was about making himself, the man Hirosuke Hitomi, disappear from this world. But first it was necessary to go as quickly as possible to T City, where the Komoda residence was, to find out if Komoda had been interred or not, and to investigate whether it would be easy to gain access to the cemetery, and to find out what kind of person Komoda’s young wife was, and about the character of the servants. He had to be sure of all that. If it looked like there might be a danger of the plan failing, it was not too late to abandon its execution. He still had time to back out.</p>
<p>However, he had to be careful about appearing in T City as he was. It would be fatal to his plan if it were known that he was Hirosuke Hitomi or even if he were mistaken for Genzaburō Komoda. So he decided to disguise himself for his first trip to T City.</p>
<p>His method of disguise was truly simple. He threw away the glasses he had worn till then and put on sunglasses of an exceptionally large-size but discreet shape. And he covered one eye from eyebrow to cheek with a large, folded piece of gauze, and put cotton wool in his mouth. Then he put on a small moustache and had his hair cut close to his head. And that was it. But the result was truly surprising, so much so that even friends he met in the train on the way to T City did not recognize him.</p>
<p>What is most prominent in a face, what reveals each individual’s personality most, are the eyes. As proof of this, the result differs completely according to whether one hides the top or the bottom of the face with one’s hand. In the first case there can be an error. But in the second case one recognizes the individual at once. That’s why first of all he used sunglasses to hide his eyes. Sunglasses will hide the expression of one’s eyes completely, but on the other hand, they may make the person who wears them look suspicious. To prevent this he put a bandage over one eye to disguise himself as a patient with an eye disease. Doing this enabled him also to cover part of his brow and cheek and thus kill two birds with one stone. By changing the way he combed his hair and the way he dressed he would achieve seventy percent of his disguise. But to make sure, he would transform the curve from his cheek to his chin by putting cotton in his cheeks and concealing the distinctive shape of his mouth with the moustache. On top of that, if he could also manage to change the way he walked, Hirosuke Hitomi would virtually cease to exist.</p>
<p>In general, he felt that wigs and makeup were not only troublesome but had the disadvantage of drawing attention to the person who used them and were not very suitable for practical use. But he believed that with a simple method of disguise even a Japanese could disguise himself completely.</p>
<p>The following day he went to the office of the lodging house and announced that, for certain reasons, he was going to leave his lodgings and go on a trip, that he didn’t know his exact destination but intended first to go south to the Izu Peninsula. And he set out carrying a small wicker trunk. En route he purchased the items he needed, and after completing his disguise on a street where there were few passersby, he went straight to Tokyo Station, where he checked his trunk in the baggage room and bought a ticket for the second or third station beyond T City before merging with the crowd of passengers in the third-class coach.</p>
<p>Once he arrived in T City, he needed no more than two days, or more precisely a single day and a night, of walking around quickly and making inquiries, to get the needed information. The details of this are too trivial so I’m going to eliminate them here. But the results of his investigations made it clear that his project was indeed not impossible to realize.</p>
<p>It was almost eight o’clock in the evening when he returned to Tokyo Station, three days after he had heard the story from the journalist. That is, the evening of the sixth day after Genzaburō Komoda’s funeral took place.</p>
<p>He intended to bring Genzaburō back to life within ten days after his death, so we have to say that he was very busy in the four days that remained. First of all, after retrieving the trunk that he had checked, he went to the station bathroom, where he took off his disguise, and after returning to being Hirosuke Hitomi again, hurried by foot to the pier of the steamship that sailed for Reigan Island. The Izu ferry left at nine in the evening, and he planned to board it to travel south of the Izu Peninsula.</p>
<p>When he reached the waiting room, the signal bell to board the boat was already echoing. He took a second-class ticket for Shimoda, ran along the dark quay shouldering his trunk, dashed up the solid gangplank, and boarded the boat just as the whistle to set sail blew and the hatchway was closed.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>His project was helped along by the fact that in the second-class cabin at the end of the boat there were only two other passengers, seemingly from the country. They were middle-aged men wearing serge kimonos and serge jackets; they had heavy-boned, sunburned faces and looked none too bright.</p>
<p>Hirosuke Hitomi entered the cabin without saying anything and took a seat in the corner farthest away from the two men. He stretched himself out on a blanket provided by the steamship company. He pretended to nap, but of course he did not fall asleep. With his back turned toward them, he spied on the two men at length.</p>
<p>The reverberations of the motors coursed through his entire body, making his nerves throb. The feeble light of a lantern encased in metal fretwork cast his shadow long on the blanket. Behind him, the two men, who seemed to know each other, remained seated, talking in low voices. Their voices mixed with the noise of the motors created a languid, sleep-inducing rhythm. The sea must have been calm, because one could barely hear or feel the roll of the waves. As he lay still the excitement of the preceding few days gradually diminished, leaving behind an emptiness, and an indescribable anxiety rose up inside him.</p>
<p>“It’s still not too late. You ought to give this up at once, give it up before it’s too late to undo. Are you seriously preparing to realize those crazy fantasies? So it really wasn’t a joke? Are you mentally sound? Aren’t you a bit deranged?”</p>
<p>His anxiety increased as time went on. But how could he just walk away from this great temptation? Facing the anxiety-ridden part of himself, his other half started to argue. “Why are you anxious? Where’s the danger? You can’t just give up the work that you’ve planned so far!” In his mind all the fine details of his scheme appeared one by one. Not a single detail had been overlooked or neglected.</p>
<p>All of a sudden he became aware that the conversation of the two men had ceased and been replaced by the sound of their snoring, which reverberated in two different rhythms from the other end of the room. He turned over, opened his eyes a crack, and saw that the countrymen were in a deep sleep; their healthy bodies were sprawled out with arms and legs extended, and their faces were completely relaxed.</p>
<p>He felt that someone was urging him to act as quickly as possible. The realization that the time to act had come swept away all rambling thoughts.</p>
<p>As if he had received an order to act, without hesitating, he at once opened his trunk, which was at his headrest, and pulled out from its bottom a fragment of a kimono. It was an old piece of cotton about six or seven inches long, torn into an odd shape. With cloth in hand, he carefully closed the lid of the trunk and stole up to the deck.</p>
<p>It was already past eleven o’clock.</p>
<p>Had the cabin boys and crew members who had looked into the cabin during the evening retired to their sleeping quarters? There was no sign of anyone on the deck.</p>
<p>The steersman on night watch was probably all the way at the fore of the vessel on the topmost deck. From where Hirosuke Hitomi stood not even he was visible.</p>
<p>Close to the gunwale he saw the foam of the giant rolling waves and the phosphorescent band of light created by fireflies extending to the end of the ship. When he raised his eyes, there was the huge dark, looming mass of the Miura Peninsula with the flickering lights of the fishing villages, and in the sky innumerable specks of stars like dust continued their slow revolution as the boat advanced. He couldn’t hear anything other than the low reverberation of the motors and the sound of the waves breaking against the bulkhead.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances there was no worry that his scheme would be discovered. Luckily, it was the end of spring and the sea was calm as if asleep. The sea route took the ferryboat closer and closer to the coast. All he had to do was wait for the spot where the boat would be as close as possible to the shore. (He was well aware of where it was, because he had taken this boat trip a number of times.) So he had just a hundred and some yards to swim to reach the shore, and all would be well if he could just do it without being seen.</p>
<p>He felt his way in the dark around the gunwale, and when he discovered a nail projecting from the outer edge of the railing, he secured the scrap of splashed-pattern cloth to it so that it would not be blown away by the wind. Then he hid himself in the shadow of a sail, took off his old, unlined kimono, which was made of the same cloth that he had attached to the nail, wrapped in its sleeves his wallet and whatever he needed to disguise himself, and tied the whole thing tightly on his back with a waistband so that it would not fall off.</p>
<p>“I’ll be freezing now, but it’s just for a little while.”</p>
<p>He crept out from behind the sail, looked around once more, and after making sure there was no one who could see him, he crawled over the deck to the gunwale like an enormous lizard and slipped over the railing.</p>
<p>He knew that he would have to jump while holding on to something so that he wouldn’t make any noise, and he would have to take care not to be caught by the propeller—two considerations that he had thought through many times. The most favorable time would be when the ship reduced its speed to change direction as it went through the channel, and that was the time when it would be closest to the shore. Hanging onto the gunwale rope, he prepared to jump as he waited eagerly for the moment when the ship changed direction.</p>
<p>Strangely, despite this intensely emotional situation, he was extremely cool and collected. Of course, jumping from a boat while it was moving and swimming to the shore was not a crime; moreover, the distance was short, and he was a confident swimmer and was aware of the fact that it was not very dangerous. Nonetheless, given his character, he could not help feeling anxious knowing that it was the first step in his great scheme.</p>
<p>In spite of that, one would have to say that it was strange that he could act in such a cool, collected manner. Afterwards, looking back at the boldness with which he had acted every day since then, he experienced a great shock when he thought about that violent change, and realized that the feeling that had taken hold of him as he clung to the gunwale rope was probably the beginning of that change.</p>
<p> Before long the ferry approached the designated spot. There was the clatter of the chains of the steering apparatus, and the ferry slowed down and began to change direction.</p>
<p>“Now!”</p>
<p>As he let go of the rope, his heart beat wildly, threatening to burst. The instant he released his hold he kicked against the bulkhead of the ship with all his might and slid silently into the water, flattening his body and riding the waves as far away from the boat as possible.</p>
<p>The dull sound of the water, the cold that suddenly overcame him, the force of the sea water that pressed in on him from all sides, his impatience at not being able to rise to the surface in spite of his struggles, and in the midst of it all, as he flailed wildly and uselessly and kicked at the water, he didn’t forget to try to get as far away from the propeller as possible.</p>
<p>How did he manage to swim through the eddies created by the boat? And how did he withstand the paralyzing cold of the water for even a short distance? When he thought about it later not even he could understand the strange power that he had had.</p>
<p>After having miraculously accomplished the first part of his project, he foundered, exhausted, on the dark beach of a fishing village he knew not where, and there he waited for the dawn while he put on his kimono, without waiting for it to dry, and disguised himself. And then before the fishermen got up he started to walk, heading in what looked to be the direction of Yokosuka.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>The man who until the night before had been Hirosuke Hitomi spent the following day in a cheap station inn in Ofuna. In the afternoon of the next day, choosing a train that would arrive in T City at nightfall, and in disguise, he joined a group of third-class passengers.</p>
<p>Readers, I’m sure you’ve already noticed. He was frittering away precious time like this because he was waiting for the newspapers to find out if the performance of his suicide had achieved what he had intended. And now that he was at last making his way to T City, it goes without saying that the newspapers had reported his suicide exactly as he had wished, under the heading “Suicide of a Novelist.” (Now that he was dead they bestowed on him the title of novelist.) Though the coverage was brief, all the newspapers ran the article about his suicide. In the papers that reported on it in relatively greater detail it said that his name, Hirosuke Hitomi, was found in a notebook in the wicker trunk that he had left behind and in which there was also a goodbye note explaining that he was tired of life, and that a piece of his kimono which had caught when he jumped overboard was still hanging from a nail on the side of the boat. These two facts clearly established the identity of the dead man and the reason he committed suicide; in short, his plan had succeeded perfectly.</p>
<p>Luckily, no one among his acquaintances was close enough to him to cry over this fake suicide. Of course, in his native village there was the family of his older brother, who had helped him with school expenses while he was studying but of late had abandoned him. And there were two or three kinsmen who would be sorry to hear about his untimely death and would regret it. He had, of course, taken these things into consideration, but they did not particularly bother him.</p>
<p>Rather, he was overcome by a strange feeling, an indescribable feeling, after he had obliterated himself from the face of the earth. He had lost his place in the civil registry of the nation. He didn’t have a single friend or human tie in this huge, wide world. He was an alien thing that didn’t even have a name. The passengers around him, the scenery outside the window that he watched moving by, the most ordinary tree, the smallest house, no longer appeared as they used to, but seemed to belong to a different world. On the one hand, it was extremely refreshing, a feeling of having been born anew; but on the other hand, he couldn’t help feeling a deep, indescribable sadness that moved him to tears when he realized that he was now all alone in the world and that he had to carry out a huge project that exceeded his capabilities.</p>
<p>The train, however, disconnected from his thoughts, continued to roll along from one station to another, and soon night fell and he arrived at his destination in T City.</p>
<p>The former Hirosuke Hitomi left the station and hurried straightaway on foot to the Komoda family temple. Fortunately, since the temple stood in a field outside the city and it was past nine o’clock, there wouldn’t be anyone passing by, and as long as he kept an eye out for the monks in the temple, he wouldn’t have to worry about being seen at his work. Moreover, since there were farmhouses in the area, it would be easy to steal a mattock from one of the barns that were always left open.</p>
<p>After scrambling over a sparse hedge that ran along the path at the edge of the rice paddy he was in the cemetery. It was a dark night but the stars were out, and since he had already been there and inspected the layout, he had no difficulty locating the fresh grave of Genzaburō Komoda.</p>
<p>He approached the main hall of the temple, which was in the midst of the tombs, and peeked through a gap in a wooden shutter. There wasn’t a sound. It was an out-of-the-way spot, and the temple monks, who would rise early in the morning, were already sound asleep.</p>
<p>After making sure that everything was all right, he retraced his steps along the same path, looking for a farmhouse in the vicinity, and found a mattock without any trouble. All this took quite a bit of time, because he had to move noiselessly like a cat and conceal himself in the darkness. So it was close to eleven o’clock when he got back to Genzaburō’s grave and began to go to work. It was a suitable hour to carry out his plan.</p>
<p>He swung the mattock at the grave in the ghastly darkness and started the fearsome work of grave digging.</p>
<p>It was a fresh grave and it was not difficult to turn over the earth. But when he imagined what was hidden below, even he who had experienced a lot in the past few days and was crazed with greed couldn’t help shuddering with indescribable fear. But he didn’t have much time to think about it. Ten blows of the mattock and the lid of the coffin was exposed.</p>
<p>Now was not the time to hesitate.</p>
<p>Summoning all his courage, he removed the soil on top of the plain wooden coffin, which appeared faintly white in the dark, forced the tip of the mattock between two boards and broke open the top, which yielded without difficulty but made a horrible screeching sound that reverberated to the marrow of his bones.</p>
<p>At that instant the soil all around started to crumble and slide down to the bottom of the coffin. Taking it for the movement of some living thing, he cringed with fear. An unspeakable, strange stench struck his nostrils when he opened the lid. Genzaburō’s corpse must have already started to putrefy, as at least seven or eight days had passed since he died. The pestilential smell forced him to step back before he even saw the cadaver.</p>
<p>The cemetery itself did not frighten him much, and until then he had been able to do his work without any bother. But once the lid of the coffin was removed and he was face-to-face with Komoda’s corpse, for the first time he felt something like an indefinable shadow rising gradually from the depths of his soul, and was so overcome by uncontrollable fear that he wanted to run away screaming.</p>
<p>It was not at all a fear of ghosts. What frightened him was something stranger, and if anything, more real. It is difficult to put into words, but it was similar to yet felt many times more frightening than when one is alone in a large, dark hall looking at one’s own face reflected in a mirror by candlelight.</p>
<p>The tombstones standing forlornly like a host of human beings under the silent, starry sky and the gaping black hole in their midst resembled a ghastly, bad picture scroll of hell. He felt as though he had become one of the persons in that painting. The dead man stretched at the bottom of the hole, who was hardly recognizable at a glance, was none other than he himself. Not being able to see the face clearly increased his apprehension.</p>
<p>A faintly white shroud appeared at the bottom of the hole, and a dead man’s head protruding from it melted into the darkness. The sight of it triggered the most frightening of illusions. Could it be that Komoda was not yet really dead and had come back to life the moment his grave was violated? Such were his wild fantasies.</p>
<p>Firmly suppressing the shudder that rose up within him, he forced himself to lie down flat on his belly by the side of the hole, stretch out both arms toward the bottom, and grope boldly for the body of the dead man.</p>
<p>The first thing he touched seemed to be a shaven head; he could feel the short stubbles of hair on the surface. When he tried pushing the skin, it was strangely flaccid and felt as though it might break at any moment if strong pressure were applied to it. He yanked back his hand suddenly at the horror of it. After a while, when the beating of his heart had slowed down, he extended his hand again and this time touched what seemed to be the mouth of the corpse. He could feel the hard rows of teeth clamped down on something soft, which was probably cotton; its softness was different from that of the putrefying skin.</p>
<p>He grew more enterprising and began to feel around the mouth. Strangely, he realized that Komoda’s mouth was stretched to a size ten times larger than it had been while he was still alive. It was open to the point where the back teeth were completely exposed, as in the mask of an open-mouthed female demon. It was opened so wide he could feel the gums of the upper and lower teeth. And that was by no means an illusion brought about by the darkness.</p>
<p>That also made him tremble from the core of his being. It wasn’t fear that the dead man was going to bite his hand. It was because he glimpsed before his eyes the frightful scene of the death agony, when even after the dead man’s lungs stop working, the muscles around the mouth, as if struggling to breathe, contract to an extreme degree and push open the lips, enlarging the mouth to an extent impossible for a living human being.</p>
<p>Having experienced this much, the Hirosuke Hitomi of a while ago already felt completely exhausted body and soul. And when he considered that he not only had to pull this slimy, rotten corpse out of the hole, but that to dispose of it he had a job that was far greater and more horrible yet, he could not help feeling all the more keenly that his scheme was the height of recklessness.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Although one could say that he was blinded by the prospect of immense wealth, the fact that the former Hirosuke Hitomi could withstand all these violent emotions was probably because, like all criminals, he suffered from a kind of psychosis. There was something wrong with his brain, and in certain situations his nerves were completely paralyzed.</p>
<p>When the fearsomeness of a crime exceeds a certain degree, the same thing happens as when one closes one’s ears and cannot hear anymore. That is, one becomes deaf to one’s conscience, while the intelligence becomes unnaturally sharp, as keen as the edge of a well-honed razor blade, and starts to work mechanically, like a finely tuned machine, enabling one to carry out any task calmly and coolly without missing the smallest detail.</p>
<p>The instant that he touched the half-putrefied corpse of Genzaburō, as his fear reached an apogee, this state of insensitivity conveniently took hold of him. As a consequence, without a moment’s hesitation he executed his scheme point by point, indifferently, like an automaton, and with perfect and complete accuracy.</p>
<p>Although he tried, again and again, to lift Komoda’s decomposing body, it slipped off his fingers each time. He felt like the old granny of a penny-candy store trying to catch pieces of jelly floating in water as he finally lifted the corpse out of the grave, taking care not to injure it. When he finished the job, the fine skin of the dead body clung tightly to the palms of his hands, like gloves made of jellyfish, and wouldn’t come off no matter how vigorously he shook his hands.</p>
<p>If it had been the Hirosuke of ordinary times, such a degree of fear would surely have had him running away, leaving everything behind. But now, without any show of shock, he proceeded to move on to the next stage.</p>
<p>Next he had to dispose of Komoda’s corpse. It had been relatively simple to make Hirosuke Hitomi vanish from the world. But to get rid of this human corpse without attracting any attention would be an extremely difficult task. If he threw it into the water or buried it, it was sure to float up or be dug up, and if even just one of Genzaburō’s bones were discovered, his entire scheme would be spoiled and he would certainly be accused of a horrible crime. That is why he had racked his brains about this particular part of his plan from the very first evening, agonizing over each and every possibility.</p>
<p>In the end he hit upon an ingenious solution, which shows, as the saying goes, the key to a difficult problem always lies nearest at hand. He went to the adjacent grave, where the bones of the Komoda family ancestors were sleeping, dug up the grave, and let Komoda’s corpse dwell with those ancestors.</p>
<p>Anyone so unfilial as to open the grave of one of their own ancestors would probably never be born into the Komoda family. And even if they decided to move the grave, by that time Hirosuke would have already realized his dream and left this world completely fulfilled. And even if that were not the case, and they were to find the bones of two people in the grave, it would just be the remains of two unknown persons who had been buried several generations before, and how could this then be connected with his evil project?</p>
<p>Since the soil was hard, digging up the adjacent grave took backbreaking effort. He was bathed in sweat. He toiled away and finally managed to unearth what looked like human remains. He didn’t find the coffin, which of course must have rotted away without leaving a trace. All he saw were small clumps of white bones strewn about, which looked faintly white reflected in the starlight. There was no smell and the bones had lost all appearance of organic matter. Rather, they made one think of a pure white mineral.</p>
<p>He rested a while in the dark before the two open graves, with the putrefying flesh of a human being in one of them, for now he had to gather his wits and concentrate on what he had to do next.</p>
<p>“I mustn’t leave anything to chance. There’s not the slightest room for error.” His head on fire, he let his eyes roam over the objects dimly visible in the darkness.</p>
<p>In a little while, without the least show of emotion, he tore off the shroud covering Genzaburō’s corpse and ripped three rings from the fingers of both its hands. When he had wrapped the rings tightly in the shroud and thrust the shroud into the front of his kimono, using his hands and feet he impatiently shoved the clump of naked flesh that had fallen at his feet into the hole he had just dug.</p>
<p>Then, moving around on all fours, he felt the dirt with the palms of his hands to make sure that he had not left any compromising evidence behind, took the mattock and filled the hole, put the gravestone back into place, and then, with grass and moss that he had set aside, carefully covered the entire surface of the earth that he had dug up, leaving no spot uncovered.</p>
<p>“Okay. It’s done. Too bad for Genzaburō Komoda. He’s changed places with me and gone from this world forever. I’ve become the real Genzaburō Komoda. No matter where they search, Hirosuke Hitomi doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p>The former Hirosuke Hitomi looked up elatedly at the starry sky. The dark vault and the sprinkling of stars like silver dust looked pretty, like a toy, and seemed to be wishing him a happy future in a small voice.</p>
<p>A grave was desecrated and the corpse in it had disappeared. Anyone knowing just this much would be stunned. But who could have imagined that, on top of that, the grave next to it had been opened and that such a simple, audacious trick had been played? Moreover, who could imagine that before they could recover their senses, Genzaburō Komoda would appear wearing a shroud? The attention of people would instantly be deflected from the grave to his very strange return to life. After that, everything would depend on Hitomi’s acting ability. The chances were great that all his theatrical efforts would fully succeed.</p>
<p>Soon, little by little, the sky took on a blue hue, the stars gradually lost their sparkle, and here and there the crowing of roosters began to be heard. In the faint dawn he hurriedly adjusted the Komoda grave to make it look as if Genzaburō had come back to life and broken the casket from the inside and crawled out. Taking care not to leave anything behind that could arouse suspicion, he slipped back to the pathway through a gap in the hedge, returned the mattock to where he had found it, and hastened toward the town in his original disguise.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>An hour later, Hirosuke, pretending to have collapsed by the edge of the road after coming back to life from the grave and tottering a third of the way back home, was wrapped in a dirt-smeared shroud and lying in the shade of a bush in the woods. Having worked throughout the night without eating or drinking since the day before, his face looked sufficiently haggard, which made his playacting all the more convincing.</p>
<p>His plan in the beginning had been to change into the shroud as soon as he got rid of the cadaver and to trace his way to the monks’ quarters at the temple and knock on the rain shutters. But when he looked at the corpse and saw that Genzaburō’s head and beard had been cleanly shaven according to an old local custom, it was necessary to shave his own head in the same manner. Since he hadn’t yet removed his clever disguise, it was unlikely that he would have been recognized if he had gone to a barbershop, but it was early in the morning, and the barbershop was not open yet, and he feared the potential risk, so he decided to buy a razor. He looked for a hardware store among the country shops on the outskirts of the city, bought a razor, and, hiding himself in the woods, with great difficulty shaved his own head.</p>
<p>He shaved himself completely, changed into the shroud, put on the rings he had taken from the fingers of the dead man, and by the time he had gotten rid of his own clothing and the rest of his belongings by burning them in a hollow in the depth of the forest and disposing of the ashes, the sun was already high in the sky and people were passing constantly along the road on the edge of the forest. So instead of leaving his hiding place to return to the temple, he had no choice but to lie in the shade of a bush, pretending to have lost consciousness in a spot where it would have taken some effort to find him yet was close enough to the road to bring about his being discovered.</p>
<p>A small stream flowed along the side of the road and the branches of densely growing bushes with small leaves hung in the water. Beyond was the forest, where tall pines and cedars grew sparsely. Taking care not to be seen from the road, he stretched himself out with bated breath on the other side of the bushes. Once he had calmed down, a queer feeling came over him as he watched through the gaps in the bushes the legs of the peasants who passed along the road.</p>
<p>“It went exactly according to plan. Now let’s hope someone will discover me. All I had to do was swim, dig a grave, and shave my head to get a hold of some dozens of millions of yen. But isn’t it all too easy? What if I’m playing the role of the fool? What if those others know what’s going on and are mocking me by pretending not to know I’m here?”</p>
<p>In this way, his nerves, which had become completely paralyzed at a time of violent emotion, bit by bit returned to their normal state. But anxiety seized him again when some peasant children set up a great outcry upon discovering his lunatic figure in the shroud.</p>
<p>There were four or five who had come into the forest to play, when one of them, suddenly noticing this figure in white, stepped back in surprise and whispered to the others, “Hey, look! There’s someone sleeping there!”</p>
<p>“A dead man! A dead man!”</p>
<p>“Let’s go and look!”</p>
<p>“Look! Look!”</p>
<p>The group of young scamps of about ten years old and wearing rustic kimonos so dirty that they shone black and the stripes were no longer visible, cautiously moved closer to him while whispering to each other.</p>
<p>He became aware that he was being stared at like some unusual sideshow attraction by sniveling, runny-nosed children with peasant faces, and as he visualized the comical scene, he grew all the more anxious and angry.</p>
<p>“What a fool I am! I didn’t expect to be discovered by peasant kids. I’ll be turned into their toy and shamed, and it will end here.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t help despairing.</p>
<p>He couldn’t very well get up and scold them. He had to pretend to have lost consciousness, no matter who was there. And so he had to patiently put up with the children, who had grown bold enough to touch him. The whole thing seemed so stupid that he felt like dropping everything and getting up in front of the children and exploding with laughter.</p>
<p>“I’m going to tell my father,” one child whispered breathlessly. And the others chimed in, “Yes, let’s go!” They ran away in all directions to report to their parents that they had found a strange, unconscious man.</p>
<p>In no time at all he heard a babble of human voices coming from the road. While a number of peasants ran toward him shouting and tried to pick him up in their arms to help him, other people, more and more of them, hearing the news, gathered and formed a large circle around him, and the commotion grew greater and greater.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it Master Komoda?” Eventually among them there seemed to be someone who knew Genzaburō by sight.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, that’s him!” answered two or three more voices. Then, within the crowd there was also one who had already heard about the strange event that had taken place in the Komoda family graveyard. “Master Komoda has come back to life from the grave!” And the hubbub about the great miracle was spread from mouth by mouth among the country folk.</p>
<p>The Komoda family was known in the vicinity of T City and even the whole of M Prefecture as the richest family in the entire region, and they were the pride of the locale. It was indeed an astonishing, extraordinary event for the head of the family, interred for ten days, to break out of his coffin and return to life.</p>
<p>Some of these people ran to T City to tell his family. Others ran to the temple, and others to the doctor’s. Everyone in the entire village had come out and was making a ruckus.</p>
<p>So the former Hitomi Hirosuke could finally see the results of his efforts. With this, there was no chance that his scheme would end in empty dreams. The time had come at last to begin playacting, the thing at which he excelled. In the midst of this group of onlookers, he first of all opened his eyes suddenly as if he had just regained consciousness. Then he looked around at their faces as if completely befuddled.</p>
<p>“You’ve recovered consciousness! Master, have you come to?” The man who had taken him into his arms brought his mouth to his ear and shouted in a loud voice. At the same time a wall of many faces leaned over him and odorous peasant breaths struck his nose. The countless eyes shining on him were filled with simple credulity, and there was not a smidgen of doubt about who he was.</p>
<p>But in spite of what went on around him, Hirosuke did not alter one iota of the farce that he had prepared in advance. He remained silent, uttering not a single word, doing nothing but gaze at the faces of the people. Pretending to be half-conscious, he avoided the trap of falling into a conversation before he had formed a clear picture of each and every thing.</p>
<p>I shall omit the details of the complications that accompanied his transport to the back room of the Komoda estate because it would become tedious. All I will tell you is that a speeding car came from the city carrying the general manager of the Komoda estate, some servants, and a doctor, and that the head priest of the family temple and his sexton, and two or three policemen from the police station, including the police chief, and persons connected to the Komoda family who had heard the news, one by one headed for the forest at the edge of town as if gathering to pay a call after a fire. The whole area was in an uproar, as if there were a war. Seeing this, you can well imagine the renown and the great power of the Komoda family.</p>
<p>All the while that he was surrounded by these people and carried to the Komoda estate, which was now his own home, and even after he had been laid upon luxurious bedding of a kind that he had never seen before, he adhered closely to his original plan and kept his mouth shut like a mute and didn’t speak a single word.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>He tenaciously kept up the discipline of silence for about a week. During that time he remained in bed in the master’s room with open eyes and ears, trying to understand the ways of the Komoda family, the characters of its members, and the ambiance of the household, and worked on himself to adapt to it. He lay motionless in bed, looking as if he were semiconscious, half-dead, but his head was running at full speed, sharply, fast but accurately, sending off sparks as it turned, as if he were racing a car at fifty miles per hour.</p>
<p>The doctor’s diagnosis turned out, by and large, as he had foreseen. The family doctor, a type of man of which there are many even in T City, tried to explain his stunning resuscitation by calling it catalepsy—a vague, learned term. He gave a number of examples to show that it was very difficult to determine what death was and to justify that his earlier pronouncement of death had not been careless.</p>
<p>Peering over his spectacles around at the family gathered at Hirosuke’s bedside, he explained at great length, using difficult technical terms, the relationship between epilepsy and catalepsy and their relationship to seeming death. Listening to him, the family seemed satisfied, although they didn’t understand very much of what he said. Since the man in question had come to life, there was no cause for reproach, even though the explanations were not entirely convincing.</p>
<p>The doctor, with an expression of anxiety and curiosity, carefully examined Hirosuke’s body. And so, with a self-satisfied look on his face, he fell neatly into Hirosuke’s trap. Bothered that he had erred in his earlier diagnosis, the doctor was preoccupied with trying to justify himself, and even if he had noticed some changes in the patient’s body, he had no time to reflect deeply upon them. Moreover, even if he might have doubted, how could he have entertained such an incredible idea as that he was Genzaburō’s double? Since such an extraordinary event as the resurrection of a dead person had taken place, it wasn’t at all strange to notice changes in the body of the person who had returned to life. Nor was it at all unreasonable for a specialist to think in this way.</p>
<p>Since the cause of death was an epileptic seizure (the doctor gave it the name of “catalepsy”), the internal organs had not been damaged. He was frail, but as far as diet went, all he needed was proper nutrition. Hirosuke’s fake illness was accompanied by feigned psychological confusion; it was painless and very easy for him, as all he had to do was to remain silent.</p>
<p>The care that he received from the people in the house lacked nothing. The doctor came twice every day to check on him. Two nurses and a maid were at his bedside around the clock. And his kinsmen and Tsunoda, the old administrator of the family property, came by continuously to find out how he was.</p>
<p>All of these people talked in hushed voices, walked without making any noise, and behaved as if they were very worried, but to Hirosuke all this was ridiculous and looked comical.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but feel keenly that the world, which up to then he had taken seriously, was now completely idiotic, a kind of child’s play. He alone seemed to grow in importance while the other members of the Komoda family seemed as small and insignificant as insects. “Is this all there is to it?” It was unexpectedly disappointing. But through this experience he felt he could imagine the puffed-up feelings of the heroes and great criminals of old.</p>
<p>But there remained among them just one who unsettled him and made him feel vaguely apprehensive, because he didn’t know how to handle the situation. That was none other than his own wife. Or, more correctly speaking, the widow of Genzaburō Komoda. Her name was Chiyoko. She was only twenty-two years old, in other words, no more than a girl. But there were a number of reasons why he couldn’t help fearing her.</p>
<p>Having previously been in T City, he knew that Komoda’s wife was a beautiful young woman. And now that he was seeing her daily, she seemed to him to belong to a type of woman whose attraction increases the more one gets to know her, and her allure steadily increased.</p>
<p>Naturally, she was the most devoted of nurses, and judging from the care with which she attended him, he could well surmise the depth of the love that bound her to the dead Genzaburō. For Hirosuke, that alone was enough to create a kind of strange anxiety.</p>
<p>At one point he had to warn himself through clenched teeth, saying, “I can’t let my guard down with this woman. She’ll surely turn out to be the greatest enemy of my enterprise.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke would never forget the scene of his first meeting with her.</p>
<p>When the car in which he was carried, still wrapped in the shroud, arrived in front of the gate of the Komoda estate, Chiyoko was most probably being restrained by someone. She didn’t step beyond the gate. Shaken by this event and supported by her ashen-faced maids, she was walking back and forth nervously with chattering teeth on the long stone path that led to the house. But the instant she saw Hirosuke in the car she looked shocked (seeing her, he was frozen with fear), and then, crying like a child, she clung to the door of the car in unseemly fashion and let herself be dragged along until the car reached the entrance to the house.</p>
<p>Unable to wait until his body was carried into the entryway and set down, she clung to him a long time, without moving, in tears, until her relatives, unable to bear seeing her this way any longer, pulled her away from him.</p>
<p>All this time, feigning a blank expression, he was obliged to look directly at her—at her face so close to his eyes that he could count each of her tear-laden eyelashes, at her pale cheeks with their fine hairs, downy as an almost ripe peach, where rivulets of tears ran down, and at her smooth, pink lips twisted into a painful smile.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. Her bare arms were around his shoulders and the mounds of her pulsating breasts warmed his chest, while her faint, distinct perfume tickled his nose. He would never be able to forget the extraordinary feeling he had at that time.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>The fear that Chiyoko evoked in Hirosuke was fear of a kind that he could not describe, and it deepened as the days went by.</p>
<p>Even during the week he was bedridden he was exposed to frightening dangers a number of times. For instance, one night he awoke suddenly from a horrible nightmare. The woman in his nightmare had been sleeping in the adjacent room but had come into his room at some point and was now quietly sobbing with her bewitching, loosened hair spread all over his chest.</p>
<p>“Chiyoko, Chiyoko, you needn’t worry so. Look at me. It’s me, Genzaburō, as healthy in body and mind as ever. I haven’t changed. Come on now, stop crying and show me your beautiful smile.”</p>
<p>He was on the point of blurting out these words but somehow managed in time to force himself to look as though he were still sleeping. Not even Hirosuke could have ever imagined that he would find himself in a situation as strange as this.</p>
<p>At any rate, he stuck to his planned script, and from the fourth or fifth day, with consummate acting skill, he began to speak, little by little, and he performed with extreme natural finesse the role of a person who had been temporarily paralyzed due to a shock and then gradually come back to his senses.</p>
<p>Drawing on what he had seen and heard while lying in bed for several days, he inferred certain things, and based on those inferences, he then pretended to recover his memory. He made it a point not to touch on matters that he had not been able to probe, and if someone brought up those subjects, he knitted his brow and pretended to be unable to remember.</p>
<p>To make this playacting seem more natural, for several days, with painful effort, he remained completely silent. That worked well, because then if he suddenly forgot something that he ought to have known, or if he talked nonsense, the others, never doubting, took pity on his unfortunate psychological condition.</p>
<p>While pretending to be an imbecile like this, he learned something from each failure and in no time at all managed to gain a thorough knowledge of the various relationships among the members of the Komoda family as well as their relations with outsiders.</p>
<p>Half a month after he had entered the Komoda household, with the approval of the doctor, it was decided to hold a big party to celebrate his recovery. Even at the banquet, he was able to obtain extremely important information from the unguarded conversations of the members of the family gathered together, from the heads of the family’s different enterprises, and the different managers and leading employees; and the day after the celebration he finally decided to take the first step toward the realization of his dream.</p>
<p>Very early in the morning, he summoned Tsunoda, his general manager, and conveyed to him his intention: “I seem to have recovered my strength. I would like to take advantage of this and take a tour of the enterprises that are under my control and of my properties and fisheries, and after clearing up my fuzzy memory, I also want to try to set up a plan to reorganize the Komoda family finances. Please take care of the arrangements.” The following day, accompanied by Tsunoda and several young men, he would set out for the different parts of the family domain spread throughout the entire prefecture.</p>
<p>Old Tsunoda opened his eyes wide in astonishment at the commanding tone of the master whom he had known to be rather retiring. He objected, saying that it would be hard on his master’s health, but flinching before Hirosuke’s thunderous reaction, he had no choice but to bow submissively to his orders.</p>
<p>Although they made the rounds at a fast pace, the tour of inspection took a full month to complete.</p>
<p>During that month he toured his fields that stretched on forever, his dense forests in which no one ever set foot, his huge fisheries, the sawmills, the dried bonito fish factories, the canneries of all kinds, and the other diverse enterprises in which the Komoda family had invested its money; and, needless to say, he couldn’t help being astounded by the extent of his own wealth.</p>
<p>I don’t have the time to record in detail what he saw and what he felt during this trip, but he was able to fully confirm that his wealth was as extensive as reported in the official register shown to him by old Tsunoda—no, actually, that it was even more extensive.</p>
<p>Wherever he went he was warmly welcomed, but all the while he was trying to determine how to sell which real estate or what enterprise at a good profit, and how he could convert them into cash, and which he should dispose of first and which last, so as not to attract too much attention. Which factory manager would be unyielding? Which forest caretaker was a little softheaded? Should he get rid of this forest before that factory? Wasn’t there an entrepreneur in the vicinity who would be interested in buying a forest? This is the way he tortured his mind.</p>
<p>At the same time he tried the best he could to take advantage of the intimacy that the trip brought about to become friendly with old Tsunoda, and he managed to soften his heart to the point where Tsunoda became his adviser on how to deal with his property.</p>
<p>And so, in the course of this trip, without using any trickery, Hirosuke became Genzaburō Komoda, the multimillionaire by birth.</p>
<p>The administrators of his holdings all kowtowed before him without showing the slightest doubt about who he was, and at the inns where he went in all locations he was received with fanfare befitting a lord. No one was so rude as to scrutinize his face, and when at times a geisha who had known Genzaburō Komoda tapped him familiarly on the shoulder and said, “Oh, how happy I am to see you again,” he became even more audacious; and the bolder he became, the more comfortable he was playing this comedy, forgetting his fear of being unmasked. On the contrary, he even felt that it was the poor student formerly known as Hirosuke Hitomi who was the fabrication.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this astounding change in his circumstances filled him with extraordinary joy. But more than happiness, he felt that it was all ridiculous. More than absurd, it stirred an indefinable emotion. While feeling a boundless impatience on the one hand, he also experienced a huge emptiness in his chest, a feeling of utter calm as if he were riding on a cloud or dreaming. In this fashion his project moved ahead, step by step; but the demon did not come from that side, from the side he had expected and against which he had erected his defense. It came from behind, from a direction that not even he had anticipated, vaguely at first, but gradually assuming a clearer shape and gnawing steadily into his heart.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>As he continued on this trip which delighted him in so many ways, Hirosuke pictured in his mind the figure of Chiyoko left at home on the estate—Chiyoko who aroused in him mixed feelings of fear and yearning. He felt the charm of her downy cheeks wet with tears in the depths of his being, and the lingering sensation of the touch of her two arms invaded his dreams at night and set his soul atremble.</p>
<p>Because Chiyoko was Genzaburō’s spouse, it was natural for Hirosuke, who had become Genzaburō, to love her, and she certainly sought the same from him. But to the extent that it would be easy to realize their desires, the situation became even more painful and worrisome for Hirosuke. At times he was seized by a crazy desire to throw his body, his heart, even his lifelong dream before her, even at the risk of a painful rebuff after their first night together, even if it meant dying.</p>
<p>His plan from the beginning was to ward off any possible danger by making her his wife in name only and to keep her as far from himself as possible. He never imagined that Chiyoko’s charms would worm their way into his heart so seductively.</p>
<p>Though his face and body and voice resembled Genzaburō’s exactly, and he could make everyone believe that he was Genzaburō, including those who knew Genzaburō intimately, after looking at the problem from all sorts of points of view, he decided that to take off the stage costume and remove the disguise and show himself stark naked in front of the wife of the dead Genzaburō in the bedroom would be too risky.</p>
<p>Chiyoko certainly knew all of Genzaburō’s little habits and even the tiniest particularities of his body like the palm of her hand. Thus, if there were a part of Hirosuke’s body that differed in the least from Genzaburo’s, he would instantly be unmasked and his scheme exposed.</p>
<p>“Even if Chiyoko were the most marvelous of women, could you abandon the dream you’ve embraced for so many years all for the sake a single woman? If you’re able to realize your dream, an incredibly intoxicating world awaits you, a world next to which the charms of a woman are nothing. Think about it. You would do well to remember just a portion of the utopia that your imagination has conceived. Isn’t the love of two human beings insignificant in comparison? You mustn’t be led astray by a momentary delusion and abandon all your efforts. Wasn’t your ambition supposed to be far greater than that?”</p>
<p>He stood at the border of dream and reality. He couldn’t give up his dream, but the temptation of reality was too strong, and he had fallen into a double, triple dilemma over which he agonized inwardly. Finally, the attraction of the dream of half of his lifetime and the fear that his crime would be discovered forced him to give up Chiyoko. To dispel his sadness and to erase from his mind the image of her lonely, melancholy face, he immersed himself earnestly in his enterprise.</p>
<p>Upon returning from his tour of inspection, he first secretly sold the least conspicuous of his stock holdings and used the proceeds to start work on preparations for the construction of his utopia. Newly hired painters, sculptors, architects, civil engineers, and gardeners thronged to his estate daily, and work on the very strange project was begun under his direction.</p>
<p>At the same time, orders were sent out for large numbers of trees, flowering plants, stones, glass panes, and considerable quantities of cement and steel. Envoys were sent as far as the South Pacific, and many laborers, carpenters, and gardeners were recruited from every locale. Among them were even a few electricians, divers, and shipwrights.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, from that time on young women who were neither maids nor servants were hired each day in such numbers that soon there weren’t enough rooms on the estate to lodge them.</p>
<p>As for the site of the construction of the utopia, having altered his plans a number of times, he finally decided to go to a solitary island in the offing at the south end of the county, and at the same time, he moved the planning office to a hastily erected barrack on the island, and all sorts of technicians, craftsmen, and laborers and a great number of mysterious women were transported there. Eventually, as the ordered raw material arrived, ever stranger, gigantic construction on the island began.</p>
<p>The members of the Komoda family and those who were responsible for the family’s various enterprises were hardly likely to keep silent upon seeing this mad activity. So as the work advanced, they crowded into Hirosuke’s receiving room every day, mingling with the engineers participating in the work of the planning, loudly criticized his recklessness, and sought to put a stop to the strange construction. But Hirosuke had foreseen their reactions when he conceived the project.</p>
<p>He was ready to sacrifice half of the Komoda’s wealth to achieve his ends. Even though they were relatives, they were all of a lower social class than the Komoda family and were also considerably less well-to-do, and so if need be he could easily silence them by generously distributing large sums of his wealth among them.</p>
<p>Thus a whole year of struggle in every sense went by.</p>
<p>To speed up the telling of this story, I’ll leave it to you readers to imagine what troubles Hirosuke experienced, how many times he tried to get rid of his project, how he almost abandoned it, and in what desperate straits he found himself in his relationship with his wife Chiyoko. I’ll simply tell you that what extricated him from all perils was the vast accumulated fortune of the Komoda family. I’ll just say that in the face of the power of money the word “impossible” does not exist, and leave it at that.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>But the wealth of the Komoda family which cut through many difficulties and bought everyone’s silence had no power over the love of Chiyoko. Even if Hirosuke was able to palliate her family with his usual tricks, there was no way for him to console Chiyoko; he could not deal with her sadness, which she herself could not handle.</p>
<p>She could not understand the strange change in her husband’s temperament after he came back to life. She had no way of solving the enigma of his change, and she had no one to confide in. She could do nothing but bear her sadness in silence.</p>
<p>Of course, she was concerned about her husband’s crazy project that jeopardized the wealth of the Komodas. But what worried her more than the material situation was how to regain her husband’s love, which she had lost. Why had her husband’s love, which had been so passionate, suddenly disappeared after that incident as if he were a different person? She thought about nothing else continuously day and night.</p>
<p>“I can sense a frightening light in his eyes when he looks at me. But it’s not a look of hatred. I can even sense in his eyes a pure, tender feeling characteristic of a first love that I hadn’t seen before. But then, why this cold and reserved attitude toward me? It’s not surprising that that terrible experience transformed him psychologically and physically. But I find it inexplicable the way he seems to want to flee as soon as he sees my face, as if he were approached by someone terrifying.</p>
<p>“If he hates me that much, all he has to do is leave me. But he doesn’t, and he doesn’t talk to me in a mean manner. And although he tries to hide it, there’s a strange passion in his eyes, as if he wants to throw himself at me. I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>If Hirosuke’s position was uncomfortable, one has to admit that hers was no less so. Hirosuke found great solace in his work, and he could immerse himself in it for many hours each day. But Chiyoko had nothing, and her family reproached her for not having the ability as a spouse to influence her husband’s behavior. That alone was enough to weary her. Moreover, the only being she had who could console her was the old governess who had accompanied her from her parents’ residence. She had no connection whatsoever with her husband’s work or with her husband himself, and her loneliness and wretchedness were incomparable.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Hirosuke understood Chiyoko’s pain only too well.</p>
<p>Most of the time he slept in his office on Okinoshima Island, and even when he happened to go back home to the estate he kept his distance and would not talk freely with her. At night he made it a point to sleep in a separate room. Almost every night he heard Chiyoko’s muffled sobs coming from the adjacent room, but having no words to console her, he usually ended up feeling like crying himself.</p>
<p>One would have to say that it was truly extraordinary to see such a strange situation continue for almost an entire year, even if he brought it about out of fear of having his plot uncovered. But by the end of the year both of them had reached their limit. And eventually the day came when an unexpected incident brought about an unfortunate rupture between them.</p>
<p>On that day, as the work on Okinoshima Island was almost finished, with all the buildings erected and gardens completed, the main participants gathered at the Komoda estate and a party was held. Hirosuke, elated that the day when his dream would be fulfilled was near, was in a sportive mood and caroused with the young engineers who joined him in celebrating. It was past midnight when the party came to an end.</p>
<p>The geisha and apprentice geisha who had come from the city to serve at the party retired one after another, and some guests had remained to stay overnight, while others had disappeared. Hirosuke was dead drunk in the middle of the party room, alone and surrounded by the aftermath of the party, like debris at low tide, and his wife Chiyoko looked after him.</p>
<p>The next morning, Hirosuke rose unexpectedly early around seven o’clock. Filled with sweet recollection but also indescribable remorse, he hesitated several times, then with beating heart, crept noiselessly into Chiyoko’s room. There he discovered a pale Chiyoko sitting motionless, biting her lips, and staring straight ahead. She seemed like a completely different person.</p>
<p>“Chiyo, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>He addressed her in a lighthearted tone, but inside he was despairing.</p>
<p>As he had already half anticipated, she continued to stare blankly into space and made no effort to answer.</p>
<p>“Chiyo …” he was about to call her again but suddenly held back because he had met her sharp gaze.</p>
<p>Just seeing her eyes, he understood everything. A distinctive part of his body had been different from the dead Genzaburō’s, and Chiyoko had discovered it the night before.</p>
<p>He vaguely remembered that at a given moment she had abruptly withdrawn from him and become stiff and immobile as though dead.</p>
<p>At that moment she must have realized something. And from morning on she was pale and more and more keenly conscious of those frightening doubts.</p>
<p>Had he not been vigilant about her from the beginning? Had he not persevered over the course of a long year, smothering his burning desire precisely to avoid such a break between them? A single night’s carelessness had brought about this irreparable error. It was over. Her doubts were certainly not going to vanish. On the contrary, they would deepen.</p>
<p>If she kept them to herself it wouldn’t be so terrible, but how could she be expected to overlook the enemy of her real husband, the usurper of the Komoda house? Eventually it would reach the ears of the authorities, and if a clever detective were to start to piece things together, the truth was sure to be exposed.</p>
<p>“You had to get drunk on sake. There’s no going back on this now.” He was seized by bitter remorse.</p>
<p>The couple remained in Chiyoko’s room, face-to-face, silently glaring at each other for a long time. But after a while, Chiyoko, as if she could not bear the fear any longer, blurted out, “Please excuse me, I’m not well. I need to be alone.”</p>
<p>And having said this much, she collapsed on the spot.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Hirosuke made up his mind to eliminate Chiyoko exactly four days later.</p>
<p>For a time, Chiyoko harbored a feeling of hostility toward him. But, thinking it over, she asked herself: “Even if there were proof that he were not Genzaburō, could there be another person in this world who looks so much like him? Of course, if one combed through all of Japan, it’s not impossible that there would be someone who had exactly the same face. But even if there were such a look-alike, she could not imagine what trick or magic he had used to get out of Genzaburō’s tomb alive.</p>
<p>When she reflected that she might have made a shameful mistake, she reproached herself for behaving so improperly toward her husband.</p>
<p>But then again, when she considered her husband’s abrupt change in character since his revival, the mysterious, major construction work on Okinoshima Island, his strange reserve toward her, and that irrefutable, compelling evidence she had discovered that night, she thought that there were grounds for suspicion, and instead of brooding over it alone, it might be better to confide in someone and seek advice.</p>
<p>Since that night Hirosuke was so anxious that he pretended to be ill and stayed in the house, not even leaving for the construction site. In this way he was able to unobtrusively observe Chiyoko’s each and every movement and get a sense of what she was thinking.</p>
<p>He was somewhat reassured that things would be all right, but when he saw that she entrusted all his needs to the maids and didn’t approach him even once and hardly spoke to him, he thought to himself what would happen if there were a slipup and his secret was somehow uncovered; no, even if his secret was not leaked to the outside, it might be discovered by the maids. So after four days of mounting hesitation, he finally made up his mind to kill her.</p>
<p>That afternoon he asked her to come to his office, and assuming a lighthearted manner, he said to her: “Since I feel better, I’m thinking of going back to the island, and I don’t think I can return until the work is completed. I want you to come with me. I want us to live together for a while on the island. What do you think about getting out for a change of scene? My unique project is almost finished and I want to show it to you.”</p>
<p>Remaining distrustful, Chiyoko invented various excuses to resist his urgings.</p>
<p>He tried coaxing, he tried threats, and after talking himself hoarse trying in vain for almost half an hour to convince her, he ended up forcing her to agree to accompany him. Surely this was because, although she suspected and feared him, Chiyoko in part of her heart felt she loved him, even if he was not Genzaburō.</p>
<p>Once they had reached that decision, they debated whether or not to take along the old governess, and in the end they decided that just the two of them would take the train that afternoon. She would not be inconvenienced by not taking anyone along because there were a large number of young women on the island who would see to all her needs.</p>
<p>After having been jostled along the coast for an hour in the train, they arrived at the station in T at the end of the train line and boarded a motorboat that was waiting to take them to the island. The boat plowed through the rough waves, and in an hour they had reached Okinoshima Island.</p>
<p>Chiyoko was afraid to be alone with her husband, but at the same time she also experienced a strange pleasure and hoped that what had happened the other evening was just a simple misunderstanding on her part.</p>
<p>To her delight, on the train as on the boat, her husband was unusually gentle and talkative, as opposed to the way he usually was, and didn’t cease to look after her, pointing out and praising the passing scenery they saw through the window—so much so that the memories of her earlier honeymoon came back to her in a flood of gentle nostalgia, and she desired so strongly that this moment of happiness would last a bit longer that she almost, but not quite, forgot those terrible doubts.</p>
<p>As the boat got closer to Okinoshima Island it drew alongside an enormous buoy floating about forty yards from the shore. On top of this buoy was a sheet of steel about eleven yards square, and in the center there was a small, open hole similar to a boat hatch. They crossed on the gangway and alighted on top of the buoy.</p>
<p>“Take another look at the island from here. Those tall rising shapes over there that look like rocky mountains are actually walls made of concrete. Seen from the outside one might mistake them for part of the island, but something marvelous is hidden inside them. And you see that enormous scaffolding rising up over the mountain there? That’s the only thing that’s not finished. Work is now in progress to produce an immense hanging garden, a garden in the sky. Come along, let’s visit the land of my dreams. There’s nothing to be afraid of. Going down this entrance, we’ll cross the sea bed and come out directly on the island. Come, follow me. I’ll give you my hand.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke spoke gently and took Chiyoko’s hand.</p>
<p>Crossing the bottom of the sea hand-in-hand with Chiyoko somehow made him happy. Knowing that he was going to have to kill her with his own hands made the touch of her soft skin seem all the more precious and dear to him.</p>
<p>They entered the hatch, walked ten to twelve yards into a dark connecting hole, and came to the entrance of a tunnel that stretched out before them, wide as a corridor in an ordinary building.</p>
<p>Chiyoko descended, and before she could take a step forward, she couldn’t help but cry out involuntarily. She was in a tunnel made entirely of glass through which she could see the bottom of the sea on all sides.</p>
<p>The thick glass plates were encased in concrete, and strong electric lights were set up on the outside, so that, within an area of five to six yards over their heads, below their feet, to the right and to the left, the strange scene of the sea bottom appeared close enough to hold in their hands.</p>
<p>Under the harsh glare of the electric lights, the viscous black rocks, the various kinds of seaweed undulating like manes of giant animals, the swimming of tremendously different varieties of fish that one simply could not imagine on earth, the giant octopuses clinging to the surface of the glass, spreading their eight tentacles like wheels and distending their large, revolting suction cups, and the shrimps writhing on the rocks like spiders, were obscured by the thickness of the water. And in the distance a dense black forest of swarming, jostling monsters created a nightmarish spectacle that one could never imagine existing on land.</p>
<p>“What do you think? You’re surprised, aren’t you? Well, this is just the entrance. You’ll be able to see even more interesting things as we go on,” Hirosuke explained exultingly as he comforted Chiyoko, who had gone pale, stricken by the sight of the extraordinary ghastly scene.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>The strange honeymoon of the former Hitomi Hirosuke, who had become Komoda Genzaburō, and his wife Chiyoko, who in reality was not his wife, was really a remarkable joke of destiny. Thus they wandered about this earthly paradise, this so-called dreamland that Hirosuke had created.</p>
<p>They were strongly attracted to each other, even though Hirosuke planned to eradicate Chiyoko and Chiyoko held Hirosuke in fear and suspicion. They felt each other out, and curiously this called forth sweet, kind feelings for each other without arousing mutual antipathy.</p>
<p>It even happened that at times Hirosuke thought about abandoning his plan to murder Chiyoko and even committing himself body and soul to this strange love he felt for her.</p>
<p>Suddenly he asked her, “Chiyoko, you’re not lonely, walking on the bottom of the ocean, just the two of us? … You’re not frightened?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not scared in the least. The scene of the bottom of the ocean that we see through the glass is really spooky, but when I think of you next to me, I’m not at all afraid.”</p>
<p>She spoke in this manner, playing up to him a little and drawing closer. Had she perhaps forgotten those dreadful doubts under the spell of the delights before her eyes?</p>
<p>The glass tunnel described a strange curve and continued on, winding endlessly like a serpent. Though lit by electric lamps equivalent to hundreds upon hundreds of candles, the darkness that pooled at the bottom of the sea could not be conquered. The cold air pressing in on them, the tremors of waves breaking far above their heads, and the wriggling, living things in the dark on the other side of the glass were a landscape of a completely different world.</p>
<p>As she advanced, Chiyoko’s instinctive shudder gradually turned to wonder, and as she grew more accustomed to it, she began to feel a strange intoxication in response to the charm of the fantastic, dreamlike depths.</p>
<p>The eyes of fish in the distance, where the electric light didn’t reach, sent out strange phosphorescent lights like lightning bugs flitting on the river surface on a summer’s night, dragging their comet tails behind them as they crisscrossed the water, moving up and down and sideways. When the fish approached the glass plate, seeking out the lamps, and crossed the boundary between darkness and light, the strange scene of their various shapes and sundry colors exposed under the lamps was beyond compare. With their giant mouths facing straight on, and without moving their tails or their fins, they cut through the water like torpedoes, and their dim shapes in the murk instantly grew large and pressed close at hand, almost running straight into their faces like trains in motion pictures.</p>
<p>The glass tunnel path ascended and descended; turned left and right, and continued for several hundred feet along the shore of the island.</p>
<p>When it ascended, the ceiling of the glass tunnel almost touched the surface of the water, and even without the power of the electric lamps, the surroundings appeared close enough to be grasped in one’s hand; and when it descended, even the electric light of several hundred lamps was not enough to illuminate beyond one or two feet, and the hellish darkness beyond extended indefinitely.</p>
<p>Although she had grown up by the sea and was accustomed to the sights and sounds of the ocean, needless to say, this was the first time Chiyoko had ever traveled so close to the sea bed in this way, and so it was truly not unreasonable that, in spite of its strangeness, its poisonousness, and its unpleasantness, she should have felt an indescribable seductive power in the inhuman beauty that drew her into the frighteningly vivid other world at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>The various kinds of seaweeds that aroused no emotion when she saw their hardened, dried-out shapes on land made her quail at the excessive strangeness of their shapes when she observed them in the water—breathing, growing, caressing each other, fighting with each other, and even conversing with each other in their incomprehensible language.</p>
<p>Slight movements in the water set the huge brown kelp forest atremble like forest treetops entangled in a storm. Horrible aname seaweed filled with holes and rotting like the faces of lepers; ezowakame seaweed slimy and quivering like giant spiders with ungainly writhing limbs; kajime seaweed that looked like sea-bottom cactuses; ohobamoku seaweed comparable to large groves of palm trees; tsurumo seaweed like disgusting old roundworms; blue seaweed that burned with green flames; and great fields of miru seaweed covered every corner of the ocean bottom, leaving portions of rocks exposed here and there. One could only guess at the shapes of their roots and at the frightful living things that nested in them, for only the tips of the leaves of the upper parts were visible, tangled together like countless snake heads sporting and quarreling with each other. They looked at them in the dim electric light cast by the projectors through several thicknesses of greenish water.</p>
<p>One spot looked like the aftermath of a huge massacre; there were clumps of amanori seaweed dyed the color of black blood; cow-hair seaweed that looked like redheaded women tossing their hair; bird-feet seaweed shaped like the claws of chickens; centipede-seaweed that looked like giant red centipedes; and, especially disgusting among them, clumps of bright-red cockscomb seaweed that one might mistake for a flower bed of cockscomb sunk to the bottom of the sea. The ghastliness of seeing all this red at the bottom of the pitch-dark sea was something that one could never imagine on earth.</p>
<p>Moreover, the tens of hundreds of glowworms mentioned before flitted about, cutting through those muddy, strangely shaped clumps of gold, blue, and red seaweed entangled like innumerable snake tongues, and as they entered the area lit by electric lamps they revealed their strange shapes as in a magic lantern.</p>
<p>Ferocious-looking horned sharks and tiger sharks flashed their white mucous membrane stomachs as they quickly cut through the field of vision like passing demons. At times they smashed into the glass wall with glaring, malevolent eyes and even tried to devour it. Their thick, greedy lips adhering to the other side of the glass and dirtying it with their saliva, and the way they came, twisting their bodies, were so suggestive of a villain attacking a woman that Chiyoko instinctively shuddered.</p>
<p>If one likened the small sharks to fierce submarine beasts, one could compare the crustaceans to birds of prey dwelling in the water, whereas the conger eels and rays resembled venomous snakes.</p>
<p>People living on land who have never seen live fish except in the glass boxes of aquariums might find this comparison quite exaggerated. But persons who have not actually entered the ocean and seen them cannot imagine what something like the gentle shrimp, which one can eat without ill effect, looks like in the water, or what kind of eerie sinuous movements the conger eel, which belongs to the sea serpent family, makes as it moves among the seaweeds.</p>
<p>If beauty gains in depth when colored by fear, then there is probably nothing more beautiful in the world than the spectacle at the bottom of the sea. At least Chiyoko felt that through this first-time experience she had encountered a kind of fantastic beauty that she had never known before.</p>
<p>She let out a cry of admiration and paled in an excess of fear and joy as she clung to the arm of her husband when she sensed that something gigantic was coming from the dark depths and she faced a brightly striped male sea bream whose two phosphorescent bands dimmed as it emerged into the electric light.</p>
<p>On its pale, shining, corpulent, diamond-shaped body, two wide stripes extended laterally like sun rays on the Rising Sun flag of the Japanese navy. The bright, blackish-brown stripes shone almost golden under the electric lights. It had large eyes and protruding lips like a vamp and a conspicuously extended dorsal fin reminiscent of the ornament of a helmet of a Warring States general.1 And she couldn’t help crying out aloud in wonder a second time when the fish began to swim, undulating straight toward her, getting close and closer and then changing direction and skirting the glass.</p>
<p>But what was most wondrous to her was that this was not the design of a painter that becomes a work on canvas, but a living creature. She gazed at it under the dim electric light against the background of strange seaweed and dark, murky water. To say that she was astonished is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>As she went on, she had no time to be amazed by the one fish because on the other side of the glass pane a number of all sorts of creatures—some brilliant, some revolting, some beautiful—came to greet her, such as sparrow sea breams, rhombus sea breams, goblin sea breams, and hawk-wing sea breams. Some had stripes that shone violet with a golden tinge, others were spotted as if dyed with paint. It was nothing other than a nightmarish beauty, a truly night-marish beauty capable of making one shudder, if one may say so.</p>
<p>“I still have a lot I want to show you. I’ve invested my entire life and all of my wealth in this enterprise, paying no attention to the warnings that people gave me. It’s not finished yet, but I want you to be the first to see it. To see how beautiful my works are. And I’m eager to hear what you have to say because I believe that you’re capable of understanding the value of my work…. Look! Take a look over here! You’re going to notice that the sea here appears completely different,” he whispered into her ear with passion.</p>
<p>In the spot he pointed out to her at the bottom of the pane there was a curious thickening of three inches that looked as if another sheet of glass had been placed over it. Chiyoko bent over as urged and looked at it apprehensively.</p>
<p>At first she didn’t understand what he was pointing at because a mass of cloudy matter extended over her entire field of vision. But as she adjusted the distance between her eye and the glass, she saw distinctly something horrible writhing on the other side.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>From the sea bed where a pile of rocks had rolled down, numerous brownish bags floated up toward the sky like airship gasbags arranged vertically. The movement of the water was making them sway.</p>
<p>As she gazed, fascinated by the strangeness of the spectacle, before she knew it the water behind the bubbles was violently agitated by a huge, horrible creature that looked like a flying dragon of the kind that appears in old paintings. Plowing its way through the bubbles, the creature slowly crawled toward her.</p>
<p>She felt as if she were being pulled by a magnet. She didn’t have the strength to move away. But she recovered some of her composure as little by little she began to realize what was going on. Without moving, she continued to observe the strange spectacle. Then the monster, which was several times larger than a dirigible gasbag, steadily made its way on small, gnarled paws in her direction, shaking the growths piled high on its back; in the middle of its enormous head that was turned toward her a mouth gaped so wide that it seemed to split the face in two.</p>
<p>Oh, the terror of that moment when it came before her eyes! Viewed from the front it looked as if the monster was all head. Its mouth opened just above its short legs, and its small eyes resembling those of an elephant adjoined the protuberances on its back. Its rough and uneven skin was covered with a multitude of bumps topped by ugly black spots. It was as big as a small hill, and it was right in front of her.</p>
<p>“Darling, darling …!!!”</p>
<p>Tearing her eyes away, she screamed, turning toward her husband as if she had been attacked.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s simply the magnifying power of the glass. What you just saw … look at it now through the glass over here. It’s nothing but a little fish, you see? It’s called a frog fish. It’s a kind of sea toad. It can crawl on the bottom of the sea on its feet, which are actually oddly shaped fins. And those things that look like little pockets? As you see now, they’re a kind of algae known as watamo. They’re shaped like little bags, don’t you think? Let’s go on. I gave orders to the people on the boat, so if we arrive in time and continue on we should be able to see more interesting things.”</p>
<p>Although she heard her husband’s explanation, Chiyoko had difficulty resisting the strange pull exerted by the desire to gaze upon the frightening spectacle, and she had to look at it again and again, twice, three times, through the magnifying glass that Hirosuke had placed there as a prank.</p>
<p>But what astonished her most was not the cheap lens apparatus, or the commonplace algae, or the varieties of fish, but something many times more enchanting, splendid, and mysterious.</p>
<p>After walking a while, she became aware of a faint noise far above her head that felt more like a kind of wave motion. Sensing something, she came to a halt. Suddenly she saw lit up by the electric lamps the fantastically smooth, white body of something like an extraordinarily large fish that moved about at a terrific speed in the dark water, leaving behind a wake of miniscule bubbles. It disappeared amid a growth of algae that were moving their feelers as if in search of food.</p>
<p>“Darling …”</p>
<p>Once again, she could not stop herself from clinging to her husband’s arm.</p>
<p>“Look over there, look at those algae!” Hirosuke whispered in her ear to encourage her.</p>
<p>The glowing tapestry of the laver bed was in great disorder, and countless bubbles shiny as pearls rose up from it. When one looked closely one could see in the spot where the bubbles rose a pale, smooth mass shaped like a flounder stuck to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Then came into view a swirl of black hair, disordered and undulating like haze, that one could have mistaken for kelp. Then beneath it a white forehead and two smiling eyes, then red lips baring white teeth appeared, and then the whole body of a woman came into view. She faced forward while gradually coming closer to the glass, approaching on her belly.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be alarmed about. It’s a woman, a skilled diver whom I hired. She’s come to greet us,” explained Hirosuke, catching in his arms Chiyoko, who was about to topple over. Breathing heavily, she began crying like a child.</p>
<p>“I was so shocked to see a human being on this sea bottom.”</p>
<p>Once she reached the glass tunnel, the naked woman at the bottom of the sea stood up gently as if floating. With one hand resting against the glass wall, black hair floating and turning above her head, her face distorted by a painful smile, breasts rising, and the surface of her body sparkling with water bubbles, she began walking slowly alongside the two people in the tunnel.</p>
<p>Led by the mermaid on the other side of the glass who showed them the way, the couple moved forward. The narrow path on the bottom of the sea curved as they went on, and in given places, whether intentionally or accidentally, the glass was curiously deformed—so much so that each time she passed in front of them, the woman’s naked body looked as if it were split in two, or else her head was separated from her trunk and floated off, or her face alone was hugely magnified. And whether these appearances were infernal or heavenly, they appeared in succession as if they had come from a strange, otherworldly nightmare.</p>
<p>But soon the mermaid, unable to stay under water any longer, spewed out the air she had stored in her lungs, and as the amazing quantity of bubbles disappeared toward the sky, she cast a fleeting smile and started her ascent, using her feet and hands as fins. Her legs kicked like a naughty boy stamping his feet in a tantrum, and her nude figure vanished from their field of vision; soon all they could see were the white soles of her feet fluttering far about their heads.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Through this strange undersea trip, Chiyoko’s heart escaped the world of ordinary mortals and began wandering in an endless world of dreams.</p>
<p>T City, the estate of the Komodas who lived there, her own family—all of this seemed to be no more than a dream she had had in the far past. Human bonds such as the ones that unite parents to their children, husbands to their wives, and masters to their servants disappeared from her consciousness like mist. An inhuman fascination that ate into her soul, and a deep yearning for the man before her (whether or not he was her real husband) that paralyzed her physically and mentally, had taken hold of her being with the intensity of fireworks in the night sky.</p>
<p>“We’re going to take a rather dark path now, I’ll hold your hand, because it’s dangerous.” Hirosuke turned around and spoke gently to Chiyoko when they arrived at the spot where the glass tunnel ended.</p>
<p>“All right,” she answered, holding on to his hand.</p>
<p>The path suddenly darkened and led into a hole dug into the rock. It was so narrow that a single person could barely pass through it. Chiyoko, unable to tell whether they had come up to the land or were still in the rock cave at the bottom of the sea, was indescribably frightened, but more than that she was happy and fulfilled to be feeling the strength of the arm of the man who grasped her hand tightly, and she had no time to dwell on the fear aroused by the darkness.</p>
<p>After they had groped their way in the dark for what seemed to her to be at least a half a mile but in fact was no more than a dozen feet, a view suddenly opened up in front of them, and she let out an involuntary cry of surprise at the grand spectacle that spread before them.</p>
<p>A huge valley, bordered on either side by imposing cliffs that seemed to touch the sky, stretched out in a virtually straight line as far as the eye reached. The vista was breathtaking. A still, deep-emerald-green body of water sixty yards wide extended into the distance as far as one could see.</p>
<p>At first glance it seemed to be a natural valley, but upon careful observation it gradually became clear that it was all artificial. It wasn’t that there were no traces of the woodsman’s axe. It was because it was too carefully arranged and lacked variety.</p>
<p>There was not a speck of debris floating on the water, and not a single weed grew on the cliffs. The rocks were a continuous smooth, dark color like slices of sweet bean cake. The darkness was reflected in the water, and the water was as black as lacquer. When some time ago I said that the view opened before them, I didn’t mean it in the sense of the scenery suddenly becoming bright. The valley was so long that the other end was hazy, and the soaring cliffs were bewitchingly dark, like the makeup of a vamp. As for light, there were narrow strips of sky in between the overhanging precipices. It wasn’t the sort of light that one sees on a plain. It was gray even in the daytime, as if it were twilight, and stars sparkled in the sky.</p>
<p>What was even stranger was that the cliffs encased not so much a valley that extended indefinitely but rather an extraordinarily deep, long, and narrow pond; one end adjoined the path from the sea bed from which the two had emerged, and the opposite end, which appeared far away in the mist, ended in a strange staircase.</p>
<p>Located at the spot where the two sides of the enclosing cliffs gradually narrowed and came together, the staircase soared in a straight line from the water’s surface up into the clouds. The strange stone staircase traced a beautiful line against the surrounding darkness. It was the only thing that appeared white. Descending like a waterfall, its simplicity lent it a splendid, sublime beauty.</p>
<p>While Chiyoko was enraptured by this grandiose setting, Hirosuke seemed to signal something, and from nowhere there suddenly appeared two extraordinarily large swans that lifted their necks proudly and created beautiful wakes with their full breasts as they slowly approached the shore where the two were standing.</p>
<p>“What huge swans!” Chiyoko exclaimed marveling.</p>
<p>At almost the same time, a beautiful human female voice seemed to resonate from the throat of one of the swans.</p>
<p>“Would you please come aboard?”</p>
<p>Then, without giving her sufficient time to be startled, Hirosuke swept Chiyoko up in his arms and placed her on the back of one the swans that floated before them, then mounted the other bird.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be afraid of, Chiyoko. They’re my servants. Let’s go, swans. Take us over there to that stone staircase.”</p>
<p>As the swans spoke a human language, it was certain that they understood their master’s order, and they started to swim abreast, slowly tracing a white line on the lacquer-like surface of the water.</p>
<p>Although she was stunned by the extraordinary strangeness of it all, Chiyoko eventually became aware that what was moving beneath her thighs were not the muscles of a water bird. Indeed, after a while she could confirm that they were surely the muscles of a human body hidden under the plumage of a bird.</p>
<p>She sensed that it was a woman in a prostrate position inside the costume of a swan who swam, paddling with her hands and feet. Indeed, the supple movement of the soft flesh on the shoulders and buttocks, and the warmth of the skin penetrating through the clothing, both felt like the body of a human, of a young woman.</p>
<p>But Chiyoko did not have time to dwell on the true nature of these swans because she was forced to open her eyes to a yet stranger and more captivating spectacle.</p>
<p>The swans had swum about fifty yards when something close to her shot up from the bottom of the water. No sooner had it surfaced than a figure swimming alongside the swans twisted toward her. The smiling face turned in her direction; looking at her over a shoulder was none other than that of the mermaid who had surprised her a while ago at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>“You’re the person we met a while ago, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>But the mermaid simply smiled modestly without saying a word and continued to swim slowly while greeting her. She was even more surprised to discover that the mermaid was not alone. In no time at all she was surrounded by two, three, then a whole group of young, naked women whose numbers multiplied as they dove, erupted from the water, and played together. She had barely beheld them swimming abreast of the two swans when they swam past them in overarm style to reappear much farther ahead. There they beckoned with their hands and frolicked, making their stark naked, voluptuous shadows dance against the background of the dark cliffs and lacquer-black water, looking ever so much like figures in a painting from Greek mythology.</p>
<p>When the swans finally reached the halfway mark of their journey swimming alongside the mermaids, at the top of the cliffs appeared the figures of a number of similarly stark-nude women outlined against the blue sky, who called to the mermaids in the water. They too must have been exceptional swimmers, because one by one they were aiming for the water dozens of feet below and diving into it.</p>
<p>Some of them dove headfirst, their hair blown in all directions; others clasped their knees and turned somersaults in the air; others yet stretched out their arms and bent their backs like bows. Holding various positions, they whirled down the side of the black cliff like flower petals dancing in the wind and sent up spray before sinking deep into the water.</p>
<p>The two swans, surrounded by all those bodies, quietly made their way to the bottom of the designated stone staircase. Close up, one was overtaken by an uneasy feeling just looking up at the pure white staircase with its countless steps rising up to the sky.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>“I will never be able to climb it” was the first thing Chiyoko said upon dismounting from the swan and stepping on land. She was very frightened.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s not as difficult as you think. I’ll give you my hand. Try climbing, it’s not at all dangerous.”</p>
<p>“But …”</p>
<p>Ignoring Chiyoko’s hesitation, Hirosuke took her hand and started to climb. Before she could protest they had already climbed some twenty steps.</p>
<p>“You see, there’s nothing at all to be afraid of. Come on, we’re almost there.”</p>
<p>They continued climbing, step by step. What was strange was that in no time at all they had reached the top of the staircase, which when seen from the bottom had seemed to consist of many hundreds of steps rising into the sky but in reality consisted of but a hundred or so steps and was not nearly so high after all.</p>
<p>But why did it appear to be so high? Even if it were an illusion produced by fear, the difference between what she thought she had seen and the reality was so great that she had difficulty accepting it. Later she understood that, in the same way in which she had earlier mistaken the sea bream at the bottom of the sea for a prehistoric monster, the whole island was full of visual illusions that enhanced the beauty of its scenery. The height of the staircase could be counted as one of those illusions, but she would not understand the reason why until she had heard Hirosuke’s detailed explanation.</p>
<p>They had finished climbing and were standing on the platform on top of the staircase, surveying the land they were going to cross.</p>
<p>There was a narrow grassy slope and at its bottom a path led straight into a dense forest. Behind them the deep valley in the shape of a giant boat opened its black mouth, and far below, at the bottom of that gloomy precipice, they beheld the forlorn sight of the two white swans that had borne them. They now appeared as two little bits of white paper floating on the surface of the water. And soon their destination was the dark, humid forest.</p>
<p>Exposed to the full sun rays of the late spring afternoon, the small lawn that demarcated those two completely different landscapes was flaming red, and white butterflies fluttered low in the shimmering heat that hung over the grass. Chiyoko could not help being struck by the unnaturalness of the beauty of the singular scene.</p>
<p>The great forest of ancient cedar trees stretched as far as the eye could see and rose in the shape of a mass of clouds. Branch entwined branch, and leaves piled up one on top of another. In the sunshine they sparkled gold, but in the shade it was as murky and black as the bottom of the sea and created a strange, uneven pattern. What was really frightening about this forest was the strange feeling that gradually arose in the heart of a person who stood on the grass and steadily surveyed the whole of it.</p>
<p>The thing that brought about this feeling may have resided in the magnificence of the forest that seemed to cover and weigh down the sky. Or it may have been the oppressive wild odor emanating from the sprouting buds. But in addition to that, a keen observer would certainly have also discerned a diabolical artifice added to the whole of the entire forest, whose general shape evoked the silhouette of a fantastic creature. The traces of the artifice had been concealed with obsessive care and could only be sensed indistinctly, but that indistinctness only made the observer’s fear greater and deeper.</p>
<p>This was not a forest in its natural state but one that had been altered by the contrivances of human ingenuity.</p>
<p>As she looked at this landscape, Chiyoko couldn’t believe that her husband Genzaburō harbored in his heart this kind of frightening taste, and her doubts about the man who looked like her husband and who was now standing beside her looking innocent deepened more and more.</p>
<p>But how could one explain her strange mental state? At the same time that her frightening suspicion toward the man increased, moment by moment the feeling of attachment that she had for that enigmatic being became more and more difficult to suppress.</p>
<p>“Chiyoko, what are you thinking about? You’re not afraid of the forest, are you? I created all of it myself, you know. There’s no reason to be frightened. Come, our obedient servants have been waiting for us over there under the tree.”</p>
<p>True to Hirosuke’s words, two sleek donkeys, which had been attached to the trunk of a cedar tree at the forest’s edge, were peacefully grazing.</p>
<p>“We have to pass through this forest?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you needn’t worry. These donkeys are going to guide us safely.”</p>
<p>They mounted the backs of the toy-like donkeys and made their way into the dark, mysterious forest.</p>
<p>In the forest many layers of leaves blocked the sky from view, but the faint light of dusk shrouded the forest like mist, and it was not so completely dark as to obscure the path ahead.</p>
<p>The trunks of the giant trees were lined up like temple pillars and a bower of green leaves connected the tops of the pillars, while scattered cedar needles formed a thick carpet under their feet. The atmosphere in the forest resembled that of a worship hall in a great Buddhist temple but felt many times more mysterious, profound, and eerie.</p>
<p>But the harmony and balance of the path on the ground of this immense forest were not the design of nature. For instance, the vast forest consisted only of large cedar trees. One could not see any other kind of tree or even a single weed, and the distances between the trees had been carefully measured to create a strange beauty. The curves of the narrow path running beneath the trees displayed an unusual sinuosity that evoked a strange feeling in the heart of one who passed through there. All these features revealed the intention of their creator to outdo nature. Had not a closely calculated artificiality been figured even into such details as the delightful symmetry of the leafy bowers and the sensation underfoot of the bed of fallen needles?</p>
<p>Noiselessly, without making a sound on the deep layer of fallen needles, the two donkeys bearing their riders made their way through the semidarkness under the trees.</p>
<p>Neither wild animals nor birds made a sound. A deathly calm covered the entire forest. But soon, as they penetrated deeper, as if to offset the silence, from the unseen treetops high above their heads they began to hear the rumbling of a strange music with a mysterious melody that resembled the reverberation of a pipe organ, music so low that it could be mistaken for the murmur of the wind. The two small human beings sitting with heads lowered on the donkeys didn’t say a word. Chiyoko suddenly raised her head to say something. But she lowered her head again without speaking. The innocent donkeys moved on silently.</p>
<p>A little further ahead, she noticed that the appearance of the forest was changing.</p>
<p>A silvery light from somewhere had begun to penetrate the uniform semidarkness of the forest. Fallen needles sparkled and the trunks of the big trees were brightly lit on one side as far as they could see. The spectacle of the huge pillars, half gleaming silver and half jet-black, that stretched on indefinitely was absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>“Has the forest ended?” asked Chiyoko in a husky voice as if she had woken up from a dream.</p>
<p>“No, there’s a pond close by. We should be getting to it any minute now.”</p>
<p>Soon they arrived at the edge of the pond.</p>
<p>It was shaped like a will-o’-the-wisp of the kind that one sees in paintings. Round on one end, the bank on the other end was divided into three deep sections that looked like tongues of fire. It was filled with heavy water like mercury.</p>
<p>Its still surface was for the most part covered by the shadow of a dark, old cedar tree, except for a section that reflected a small bit of blue sky. There the music they had heard earlier did not echo. Everything was silent. Everything was still. All creation had fallen into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>So as not to disturb that stillness, the two dismounted quietly and walked wordlessly to the edge of the water. On the part of the bank that jutted out was something exceptional in this forest—a number of old camellia trees, each about three yards tall, with many blood-red flowers blooming against the dense green. Then they were astonished to discover, in a dimly lit open space in the shadows of the flowers, a beautiful young woman lying languidly, exposing her milk-white skin. Resting her cheek on her hand, propped on a bed of moss, she was flat on her belly and gazing at the water.</p>
<p>“What is she doing in such a place?” exclaimed Chiyoko.</p>
<p>“Quiet!” Hirosuke signaled to Chiyoko to be silent so as not to startle her.</p>
<p>The young woman—whether conscious of the eyes fixed on her or not—continued to gaze at the surface of the water in as distracted a manner as before.</p>
<p>The extremely simple arrangement of the pond in the forest, the camellias on the bank, and the innocent, naked young woman lying on her stomach created a splendid effect. If it was not accidental but a composition that had been planned, one would have to say that Hirosuke was an outstanding painter.</p>
<p>They stood for a long time at the edge of the bank, enchanted by the dreamlike scene, and during that time the girl continued to gaze steadily at the pond without tiring. The only movement she made was to recross her shapely legs once. Eventually, when Chiyoko, urged by Hirosuke, remounted the donkey and was about to leave, an enormous, eye-catching camellia blooming just above the girl fell like a drop of liquid, slid down her round shoulder, and floated on the water. But it happened so quietly and without disturbing the pond that not a single ripple stirred and the water surface remained as smooth as a mirror without so much as a quiver.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>The two rode on for a while under the foliage of the primeval forest, and as they moved deeper into it without an end in sight, Chiyoko wondered how they would be able to get out. She felt that she would not be able to retrace their path to the entrance, and she began to feel not a little uncomfortable entrusting their way to the indifferent donkeys.</p>
<p>But stranger yet about the landscape of this island was the fact that it appeared one was going forward when in fact one was going backward, and it looked as though one were climbing when in fact one was descending. What seemed like a low-lying area was suddenly a mountain, and before one realized it, a vast plain turned into a narrow path. One had the feeling that it was all done through various ingenious trickeries. And in this instance, too, just as the forest was at its densest and an indescribable anxiety began to rise in the hearts of the travelers, there were indications that the forest was ending.</p>
<p>Before they realized it, the trunks of the large trees, which until then had been regularly spaced apart, gradually crowded together, and in no time at all they came to a place where the trees formed a wall of several layers, growing densely and leaving no spaces. The earlier green bowers had disappeared, and foliage left to grow wildly hung down as far as the ground. The darkness deepened, making it difficult to distinguish short distances.</p>
<p>“This is where we’ll leave the donkeys. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke dismounted first, took Chiyoko by the hand, and helped her down. Then he immediately plunged ahead into the darkness.</p>
<p>They struggled through dense brush, hemmed in by tree trunks and blocked by foliage, advancing like moles, when all of a sudden they were no longer in the forest but in a bright open space on green grass with the sun shining radiantly above. Strangely, wherever they looked, all signs and traces of the forest had disappeared.</p>
<p>“What has happened?” Chiyoko pressed her temples in pained bewilderment and turned to Hirosuke for help.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not your head. Travelers on this island always have this experience of stepping from one world into a different one. I planned to create several worlds on this small island. You know what a panorama is, don’t you? They were one of the attractions that were still extremely popular in Japan when I was an elementary school student. To see it, you first had to pass along a narrow, pitch-black passageway. And the moment you emerged from it, suddenly a field of vision, a world, lay before your eyes. A world completely different from the world the spectator had been living in up to that moment. A perfect, self-contained world as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>“What a surprising trick! Outside the panorama hall, streetcars were running, stalls were selling goods, eaves of merchant houses were lined up, and townspeople were passing to and fro the same way as yesterday, today, and tomorrow. I could pick out my own house among the eaves of the merchant houses. But once I stepped into the panorama hall, all of those things disappeared, and the wide Manchurian plains extended as far as the distant horizon line. And there a gory battle, frightening to behold, was being waged.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke continued talking as he walked, disturbing the heat waves that rose from the grass. Chiyoko followed after her lover as in a dream.</p>
<p>“There’s a world outside the building. And a world inside the building. And the two worlds have their respective grounds and skies and horizon lines.</p>
<p>“Outside the panorama hall, the streets that one was accustomed to seeing everyday exist. And inside the panorama hall, no matter the direction in which you look, there’s no sign of that world, and the Manchurian plains extend to the horizon line far away.1 In other words, the double worlds of the streets and the plains exist in the same spot. At least, it gives rise to such an illusion.</p>
<p>“As for its method, as you know, a high wall on which a landscape is painted encircles the seats of the spectators, and in front of the wall real earth and trees and dolls are displayed in such a way that you cannot distinguish the boundary between the real things and the painting, and to hide the ceiling, there’s a deep canopy over the seats of the spectators.</p>
<p>“It’s that simple. At some point I heard the story about the Frenchman who invented this panorama.2 According to that story, the intention of the person who first invented it seems at least to have been to create a new world using this method. Just as novelists create their worlds on paper, and actors create theirs on the stage, so surely he too must have tried to create a wide, other world in that small building using his unique scientific method.”</p>
<p>Then Hirosuke raised his arm and pointed to the boundary line between the open green fields and blue sky that was dimly obscured by the haze of the shimmering heat and fumes that rose from the grass.</p>
<p>“Look at this huge meadow. Aren’t you struck by a strange feeling? Don’t you think that it’s too big a plain for this small island?</p>
<p>“Look! From here to the horizon line there’s certainly a distance of some miles. To tell the truth, shouldn’t the sea appear closer than the horizon? Not to mention that on this island all sorts of other scenes have been constructed, such as the forest we just passed through, and the meadow on which we are now, each stretching over several miles. And to hold all of this, don’t you think that Okinoshima could be as large as M Prefecture and still be too small?</p>
<p>“I wonder if you get my meaning. That, in fact, I’ve created a number of panoramas independent of each other on this island. Up till now we’ve only passed through the sea tunnel and the dark paths of the valley floor and the forest. They may correspond to the dark passageway leading into a panorama hall. Now we’re standing in the middle of spring sunlight and heat waves and steamy grass. Isn’t it like the bright feeling of waking from a dream that one experiences when one emerges from the dark passageway of a panorama?</p>
<p>“Now, finally, we’re ready to enter the universe of my panorama. But this panorama that I created is not a painting on a wall as in an ordinary panorama hall. I’ve carefully concealed all traces of artifice by using a well-thought-out arrangement of hillock curves that modify nature, and by carefully placing the grasses, trees, rocks, and stones. And I have extended and contracted distances in nature just as I wanted.</p>
<p>“To give an example, that immense forest we just passed through. If I were to tell you how large it really is, you’d probably never believe me; it’s that small. That path that runs through it is cleverly curved in such a way that the onlooker doesn’t realize it; it winds back many times, and the cedars that seem to stretch on either side as far as the eye can see are not all the kind of large tree you might think. The ones in the distance may be a grove of small cedar saplings a mere two yards high. Adapting the light in such a way that the viewer can’t tell the difference is not that difficult to do.</p>
<p>“The same goes for the white stone staircase that we climbed earlier. Seen from the bottom it looks high, like a suspension bridge to the clouds, but in reality it doesn’t have more than a hundred steps. You may not have noticed, but that staircase is like the backdrop scenery on a stage and the upper portion is narrower. It’s constructed so that, as it goes up, the steps gradually become shorter in a way that’s not noticeable. Moreover, I had a device added to the slope of the stone wall on either side so that the staircase appears to be very high when viewed from below.”</p>
<p>But in spite of hearing the explanation of those tricks, the power of the illusion was too strong, and deep in Chiyoko’s heart the impression of strangeness did not diminish in the least. She could not believe that the vast expanse of grassland that stretched before her eyes in reality disappeared beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>“So this plain too is actually very small?” She asked with an expression of being only half-convinced.</p>
<p>“Yes, one doesn’t notice that it’s on a downward slope because the edges are turned upward and hide a number of diverse things that are behind it. But though it’s small, the diameter is nonetheless six or seven hundred yards, you know. I simply made an ordinary open spot look boundless for greater effect. Attention to just little things like that have created a marvelous dream.</p>
<p>“And even now, though it’s been explained to you, you probably still can’t believe that this vast plain is only a hundred yards wide. Looking at the horizon line that’s undulating like a wave because of the heat waves in the shimmering heat makes even me, who am the creator, feel inexpressibly forlorn and sad, as though I’d been left behind in the middle of an infinite plain.</p>
<p>“Sky and grass as far as one can see with nothing to block the view. That’s our universe now. This plain covers the whole of Okinoshima and stretches from the Bay of T to the Pacific Ocean, and its end merges into the blue sky.</p>
<p>“If it were a celebrated Western painting there’d be a large flock of sheep and a shepherd located here. Or, one could imagine, close to that horizon line, a band of gypsies walking silently, Indian file against the setting sun, casting unbelievably long shadows on the plain. But as far as one can see there’s not a single human being, not an animal, not even a dead tree. Doesn’t this green desert of a plain stir us far more than a famous painting? Isn’t there in it something eternal that presses in on us with a terrifying force?”</p>
<p>For a while Chiyoko had been contemplating the vast sky that appeared more gray than blue, and she didn’t try to hide the tears that came to her eyes.</p>
<p>“From this plain the road splits into two. One goes toward the center of the island and the other goes in the direction of a number of scenes on its perimeter.</p>
<p>“The real itinerary first makes a tour of the circumference of the island and comes back to the center at the end. But we don’t have time to follow it today. And those sights might not all be finished, so we’re going to go directly from here to the flower garden in the center. That will probably be most to your liking.</p>
<p>“But it might seem too abrupt to go directly from this plain to the flower garden. I feel that I ought to give you an idea of the other sites as well. We have another two or three hundred yards to go to reach the path to the flower garden, so I’ll tell you about those strange sights as we walk in this grass.</p>
<p>“Do you know about the gardening art of topiary? It’s the art of cutting evergreens like boxwood and cypress into geometric forms or into the shapes of animals or heavenly bodies. In one of the scenes, beautiful topiaries like that are lined up without end. Varied forms, some imposing, some delicate, and a mixture of straight lines and curves create a strange symphony. Amid those forms, celebrated sculptures of ancient times cluster together in an awesome throng. And they’re all real live human beings. A huge gathering of nude men and women, silent and still as if turned into stone.</p>
<p>“So when the panorama island traveler leaves this vast plain and suddenly enters that place, he encounters humans, plants, and those unnatural sculptures continuing on as far as the eye can see, and he feels the suffocating pressure of a life force and discovers an indescribable, fantastic beauty.</p>
<p>“Another world is crammed with nothing but lifeless steel machines. A group of black monsters that turn round and round without end. The force that moves them is electricity generated below the surface of the island. But the things lined up there are not ordinary machines like steam engines or electric motors, but symbols of a strange mechanical power of a kind that appears in certain dreams. It’s a crazy lineup of steel machines of all sizes and no apparent utility.</p>
<p>“Cylinders like small mountains, big flying wheels roaring like beasts, giant cogwheels with interlocking black fangs locked in combat, oscillating levers that look like the arms of monsters. Crazily dancing speedometers. Crisscrossing shaft rods. Cascades of leather belts. Bevel gears, belt pulleys, chain belts, chain wheels. All of this churning blindly at an insane pace, spreading a greasy film on pitch black surfaces.3</p>
<p>“You must have seen the machine pavilion at the Exposition. There are engineers, guides, and guards. The whole area consists of a single building and the machines are all carefully built to serve a predetermined end. But my machine land is a vast, unbounded world, and every inch of it is covered with nonsensical machines. As it’s a kingdom of machines, there’s not a shadow or sign of a human being or an animal or a plant. You can imagine how a tiny human being who enters it must feel, facing this plain covered with giant machines moving by themselves and blocking the horizon line from view.</p>
<p>“And there are other worlds that have already been planned. There’s one that’s a large city filled with buildings of beautiful architecture; and another one of gardens of wild beasts, venomous snakes, and poisonous plants. There’s a world of spray and mist with fountains and waterfalls and all kinds of water games. The traveler who moves from one of these worlds to another experiences each world in turn like a dreamer who has a different dream every night. And in the end he enters a dreamlike universe of eddying auroras, suffocating odors, kaleidoscopic flower gardens, magnificent birds, and frolicking humans.</p>
<p>“But the main attraction of my panorama is not visible from here. It’s in the spectacular view of the entire island that one has from the flower garden on top of a huge column that’s being erected in the center of the island. From there, the whole island is a single panorama, an entirely different panorama made up of all the assembled panoramas. On this small island a number of universes exist superimposed on top of and opposite each other. But now, we’ve arrived at the exit from the plain. Come, give me your hand. We have to pass along a narrow path for a while again.”</p>
<p>The path was a narrow constriction in the vast plain. It was hidden from view and could be discovered only if one happened to be right next to it. They descended onto the path overgrown with dark, dense weeds; and after they had taken a few steps, the weeds became higher and higher, covering their bodies entirely, and the path plunged into pitch-black darkness.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>What kind of strange trick was this? Or was Chiyoko just hallucinating again? From one landscape they passed through a brief darkness and then appeared in another landscape as if in a dream, and the times when they moved from dream to dream she had a vague, singularly strange feeling, as if she were riding the wind, or had lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Each and every landscape was on a completely different plane. She felt that she had leapt from a third-dimensional world into a fourth-dimensional one, and before she could catch her breath, everything about the spot that she had been looking at up until then, from the forms to the colors to the smells, changed into something completely different.</p>
<p>It felt truly like a dream, or like a doubly exposed motion- picture film.</p>
<p>Hirosuke had called it his flower garden, but the world before her eyes—from the murky, milk-colored sky to the strange hillocks below it that undulated like giant waves and were ablaze with all kinds of spring flowers that covered their surfaces entirely—had nothing to do with what is usually associated with the words “flower garden.”</p>
<p>Because it was on such a grand scale, and because everything, from the color of the sky to the curves of the hills to the confusion of the thousands of flowers, was so unnatural, so indescribably artificial, whoever set foot in that world could only stand stock-still in a daze before it.</p>
<p>In this scene that seemed monotonous at first glance there was something strange, something that was no longer of the world of human beings but belonged to the world of demons.</p>
<p>“What’s happening? Are you dizzy?” asked the surprised Hirosuke, supporting Chiyoko, who was about to collapse.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have a headache.”</p>
<p>A choking smell similar to the one given off by a sweating human body, not altogether disagreeable, had enveloped her, and she felt numb.</p>
<p>She had the sensation that the numberless enmeshed curves of the hillocks covered by those strange flowers were moving toward her with the frightening force of raging, whirlpooling waves seen from a small boat on the sea. But they were in fact absolutely motionless. One could only think that the eerie, evil designs of a schemer were concealed in the folds of those immobile hills.</p>
<p>“I’m frightened,” Chiyoko, who at last recovered herself, murmured with closed eyes.</p>
<p>“What are you frightened of?” he asked with a faint smile forming in the corners of his lips.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I feel so utterly sad surrounded by all these flowers. I feel like I’ve come to a place where I shouldn’t have come and that I’m looking at things I shouldn’t see.”</p>
<p>“It must be because the scene is too beautiful,” he replied with a put-on indifference. “What’s more, look over there. They’ve come to greet us.”</p>
<p>From behind one of the flowering hills a file of women appeared like a festival parade, walking very softly as if in a procession, their bodies entirely covered with cosmetics. The swellings and hollows of the muscles of their blue-white bodies were underscored with purple makeup lines, which brought their heavily shadowed, naked bodies to the fore against the screen of the brilliant scarlet flowers behind them.</p>
<p>They approached the couple without a word and formed a ring around them, moving on their sleek, sturdy legs as if in a dance, their black hair falling in waves down their shoulders, and their bright red lips opened in the shape of half moons.</p>
<p>“Chiyoko, these are our mounts.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke took Chiyoko by the hand and put her on a lotus-flower throne made up of several nude women before seating himself beside her on the seat of flesh.</p>
<p>The human flower petals, opened wide and enveloping Chiyoko and Hirosuke, set off on a tour of the flower-covered hills.</p>
<p>Fascinated by the strangeness of the world before her eyes, and by the impassivity of the nude women, Chiyoko seemed to have lost her shyness. She even found the sensation of the softness of the fat, round bellies rising and falling under her knees pleasurable.</p>
<p>The narrow path continued, making many turns in the depressions visible among the hillocks. And where those nude women put their bare feet, flowers grew in profusion, the same as on the hillocks. The thick carpet of flowers in addition to the soft suppleness of the human flesh made their ride even smoother.</p>
<p>But the beauty of this world was not so much in the strange perfume that struck their noses, nor in the milky color of the strange sky, nor in the marvelous music that pleasured their ears like a spring breeze. Nor even in the wall of flowers with their sumptuous colors ranging from red to violet. It was rather in the strange, indescribable curves of the flower-covered hills.</p>
<p>There must have been a time in this world when humans realized for the first time the beauty that resides in the sinuosity of a curve. The human eye accustomed to the curves of nature’s hills, grasses and trees, plains, and the curves of the human body now beheld a mélange of completely different curves. The curves of the hips of a beautiful woman or the work of a sculptor could not be compared to the sinuous beauty of this world. They might have been lines drawn, not by a creator who called nature into being, but by a demon scheming to destroy it.</p>
<p>Certain individuals might experience an abnormal sexual desire in the overlapping curves, but they were by no means something that one encounters in the actual world; it is only in bad dreams that one sometimes feels desire because of such curves.</p>
<p>Hirosuke must have been trying to reproduce that dreamworld with real earth and flowers. It was disgusting rather than sublime, chaotic rather than harmonious. Each and every one of those curves and the arrangement of the inflamed, festering flowers gave infinite displeasure instead of delight. Seeing the strangely artificial mixture added to those curves was like hearing strangely beautiful orchestral music filled with exceptionally discordant sounds.</p>
<p>Moreover, the creator of this scene had extended his abnormal attention even to the curves traced by the narrow paths in the valley on which the naked women bearing the lotus-flower throne passed. It wasn’t the beauty of the curves themselves that had been planned but the so-called carnal pleasures felt by those who moved along them.</p>
<p>Some of the lines were supple. Others had sharp angles. Some rose and some fell. The paths traced beautiful curves up and down, left and right. Should we say that they were made gentle and beautiful like the pleasurable curving motions felt by a pilot in the sky or by the driver of a car running along the edge of a mountain road?</p>
<p>Although the path went uphill, from time to time it appeared to go down, little by little, toward a central point. The unusual scent and the echoing music, which seemed to come from the depths of the earth, increased in intensity and went on without pause, numbing their noses and ears with their beauty.</p>
<p>From time to time the valley broadened into a field of flowers beyond which a mountain of flowers rose like a bridge suspended in the sky. And on that vast incline opened up a magical spectacle many times greater than the clouds of flowers of Yoshino.1 Even more astonishing were the groups of dozens of completely nude young men and women running through the rainbow of flowers on those slopes and plains, those far away appearing as small as white beans as they amused themselves playing at Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>A woman running down the mountains and crossing the plain, her black hair streaming in the wind, came to within yards of where they were and suddenly fell down. Then an Adam who was pursuing her lifted her up and held her straight across his broad chest, and both the one who clasped and the one who was clasped joined their voices to the music that filled this world, singing together in sonorous voices as they slowly departed for the beyond.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, overhanging the narrow valley road like an arch, an enormous, white-spotted eucalyptus tree stretched its branches heavily laden with fruit that were actually nothing other than naked women. They stretched out on the thick branches or hung from them with two hands, and while moving their heads and arms and legs like leaves shaken by the wind, they sang in chorus the music of this world. The lotus throne of naked women paraded quietly under those fruits in a curiously detached manner.</p>
<p>The author can only describe the strange feeling that Chiyoko had as they passed through this scene of flowers, which seemed to stretch for a good mile, as in a dream or a nightmare.</p>
<p>Finally they were transported to the bottom of a gigantic basin of flowers. The strangeness of that scene was due to the clusters of snow-white flesh that rolled like chains of stringed dumplings from the surrounding mountaintops, along the edge of the basin, and down the gentle slopes covered with flowers, setting up a spray in the basin filled with water at the bottom. The young women continued to sing that song in unison while splashing water and jumping around in the vapor at the bottom of the basin.</p>
<p>When had their clothes been removed? Almost in a transport of rapture, Chiyoko found herself with Hirosuke in the midst of those splendid bathers soaking in the wonderful bath. In this world where one would have been embarrassed wearing clothes, even Chiyoko was able to forget her own nudity. Here the naked women who carried them literally played the role of the lotus-flower throne and supported with their bodies the two masters, who stretched out and stayed for a long time, soaking in the warm water up to their necks.</p>
<p>Then an indescribable disorder began.</p>
<p>The streams of the waterfall of flesh became more and more tumultuous. The flowers along the way were crushed underfoot and kicked about and became a blizzard of blossoms as far as the eye could see. In the jumble of petals and vapors and water spray, the flesh of nude women rubbed against flesh and all were thrown together in confusion as in a tub of potatoes. They continued to sing in unison, now faintly, and in the middle of the enormous human wave that broke, now to the left, now to the right, as bodies rubbed against bodies and dashed against the sides of the basin, the two guests, who had lost their senses, were left floating like corpses.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Night came before they realized it.</p>
<p>The milky sky turned dark with evening storm clouds, and soon ominous thunderheads were towering over the charming hills where hundreds of flowers bloomed in profusion. The turbulent human wave and the chorus disappeared like a receding tide, leaving Hirosuke and Chiyoko alone by themselves in the vapor that rose white in the dark night.</p>
<p>They also suddenly realized that the women who had served as their lotus-flower throne had disappeared without a trace. Moreover, already that unusual, voluptuous music that had seemed to symbolize this universe could no longer be heard. Together with the unfathomable darkness, a hellish silence enveloped the entire world.</p>
<p>“Well, then,” Chiyoko, who had regained her senses, couldn’t help exclaiming once again as she had many times before. But as she sighed with relief, the fear that she had forgotten rose in her chest like a wave of nausea.</p>
<p>“Let’s go home,” she said, cajoling her husband while trembling in spite of the warmth of the water. Only his head floated on the water like a black buoy, and although he heard her, he neither moved nor answered her.</p>
<p>“It’s you over there, isn’t it?” she cried in fear, and she drew closer to the dark lump, clasped his neck, and shook him with all her strength.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re going home. But before we leave I want to show you something else. Don’t be frightened. Be calm,” he answered slowly, as though he were thinking of something, which frightened Chiyoko even more.</p>
<p>“But right now I can’t take it anymore. I’m scared. Look how I shake. I can’t stand one more minute of this terrible island.”</p>
<p>“You’re really shaking, aren’t you? But what’s so frightening?”</p>
<p>“The strange contraptions on this island are frightening. And you who thought them up are frightening.”</p>
<p>“You’re frightened of me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but don’t be angry. You’re all that I have in this world. And yet of late, for some reason, you’ve suddenly become frightening. I’ve come to doubt whether you really love me. I’m so frightened when I think that in the darkness of this terrible island you’re going to suddenly tell me that you don’t love me.”</p>
<p>“You’ve said some strange things, haven’t you? You’d better be quiet for a while. I understand what you feel. But what on earth happened to you in this darkness?”</p>
<p>“But it’s just now that I’ve begun to feel like this. Perhaps I’m wound up after all I’ve seen. Now, unlike the way I usually am, I feel I can tell you what I think. But please don’t get angry.”</p>
<p>“I’m very well aware of the fact that you have doubts about me.”</p>
<p>Chiyoko was astonished by Hirosuke’s tone, and she suddenly fell silent. Strangely enough, she had the impression that she had experienced the very same scene in a dream—or was it in reality? It even seemed that it could have happened before she was born.</p>
<p>At that moment, too, they were in the midst of an infernal darkness like two small dead people facing each other with only their heads above water. The man beside her answered, “I know very well that you suspect me.”</p>
<p>Chiyoko sensed that she had known before quite well what was going to follow, what she was going to tell him and the attitude that he would take. She even sensed what the terrible end would be and what would come afterwards, but she could not for the life of her recall the details.</p>
<p>“I know very well,” repeated Hirosuke as if to urge on Chiyoko, who had fallen silent.</p>
<p>“No, no, you mustn’t. Please don’t say any more!” Chiyoko screamed to stop Hirosuke from continuing. “I’m afraid to talk to you. Please don’t say anything. Take me back home as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>At precisely that moment a violent, earsplitting sound rent the darkness. Chiyoko at once groped for and grasped her husband’s neck as sparks of fire flew in all directions and a luminous, multicolored form spread in the sky over her head.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid. Those are fireworks, Panorama Island fireworks that I created. Look! As opposed to ordinary fireworks, mine remain a long while in the sky, as if they were projected from a magic lantern. Look! This is what I wanted to show you.”</p>
<p>True to Hirosuke’s words, a giant, shining silver spider spread over the sky as if it had been projected against the clouds and wriggled the joints of its clearly delineated legs as it gradually descended in their direction.</p>
<p>It was a picture drawn on the sky with fire in a fantastic manner, and the spectacle of the enormous spider covering the dark sky exposing its ghastly, naked belly and writhing as it came closer overhead would have been beautiful to some people. But Chiyoko, who hated spiders, could hardly breathe she was so frightened. But as hard as she tried not to look, there was a strange attraction in that fear that compelled her to turn her eyes toward the sky and watch the monster getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>Now more than the spectacle, what made her tremble was the consciousness that among her experiences this was the second time that she was seeing this giant spider fireworks.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see these fireworks anymore. Stop making me afraid. Please let me go home. Let’s go home,” she finally managed to say between her teeth. But at that moment, the fiery spider had already merged into the darkness without a trace.</p>
<p>“Are you scared of even fireworks? What am I going to do with you? The next one should be a flower opening and not so frightening. Be patient a bit longer. Look, you remember those black cylinders rising up on the other side of this pond, don’t you? Those are the cylinders for the fireworks. Our subterranean city is located below this pond. And that’s where my servants set off the fireworks. There’s nothing at all strange or frightening about it.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke’s hands grabbed Chiyoko’s shoulders with the unsuspected force of an iron vise. She was now like a mouse caught in the claws of a cat, incapable of running away no matter how she tried. “Ah!” She couldn’t help screaming, “Forgive me! Forgive me!”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, you say, but what have you done to be forgiven?” Hirosuke’s tone of voice grew more and more forceful. “Tell me what you’re thinking. What do you think of me? Tell me honestly!”</p>
<p>“I’m scared, scared.” Chiyoko’s voice was choked with sobs.</p>
<p>“This is the best time. There’s nobody around. No matter what you say, no one will hear you as you fear. We needn’t keep secrets from each other. Go ahead and say what you have on your mind.”</p>
<p>In the tub at the bottom of the dark valley a strange dialogue began. The extraordinary spectacle before them fed the madness in their hearts. Chiyoko’s voice especially was strangely high-pitched.</p>
<p>“So, then, I’m going to tell you.”</p>
<p>Chiyoko suddenly became talkative, as if she had undergone a transformation.</p>
<p>“I confess that I’ve wanted to hear it from you for some time but didn’t know how to ask you. Please don’t keep me in such suspense. Tell me the truth…. You’re not Genzaburō Komoda but someone else, aren’t you? Please tell me. For a long time after you came back alive from the cemetery I doubted who you really were. Genzaburō didn’t have that terrible gift of yours. Long before I came to this island I already suspected that you weren’t him. Maybe you were aware of it. And then when I saw those intimidating, yet strangely seductive scenes, I believe that any doubts I had vanished completely. So please tell me.”</p>
<p>“Aha! Finally you show your true colors.” Hirosuke’s voice was unpleasantly calm, yet could not conceal a certain desperation. “I made a terrible mistake. I shouldn’t have fallen in love with you, but I did. You don’t know how I had to suffer. In the end I couldn’t endure it. And as I feared, you ended up realizing who I really am….”</p>
<p>Then with the eloquence of one possessed, Hirosuke started to give a sketch of his scheme.</p>
<p>During that time, too, the men in charge of the fireworks who were underground did not know what was going on and continued to release one rocket after another, trying thus to please their master. The glittering flames that crossed the dark heavens in the shapes of fabulous animals, weirdly beautiful flowers, and other fantastic, extravagant forms in poisonous blues, reds, and yellows dyed the surface of the water at the bottom of the valley, where their heads were floating like two melons, and every detail of their facial expressions was reflected in the colored lights.</p>
<p>The face of Hirosuke, who continued to carry on passionately, turned as red as the face of a drunkard, then as blue as a cadaver’s, and then as frighteningly yellow as a person with jaundice. Sometimes only his disembodied voice issued from the darkness, merging with the strange content of his tale to threaten Chiyoko to an extreme. Her fear became unbearable and she tried to flee several times, but Hirosuke wouldn’t release her from his mad embrace.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>“I don’t know to what extent you guessed my intention, you’re so intuitive. I imagine that you guessed quite a bit. But even you didn’t know that my scheme and my logic were as firmly rooted as they are.”</p>
<p>At the very moment Hirosuke stopped talking, a bright-red firework colored the sky without falling. Hirosuke glared at her steadily with the visage of a red demon.</p>
<p>“Let me go home. Let me go home,” begged Chiyoko, over and over, between sobs, forgetting all sense of propriety.</p>
<p>“Listen to me, Chiyoko!” shouted Hirosuke to silence her.</p>
<p>“Do you think I could let you go home after all I’ve told you? You don’t love me anymore? Until yesterday—no, until just moments ago—didn’t you love me even as you doubted whether I was really Genzaburō? And as soon as I honestly confess, you hate and fear me as your mortal enemy?”</p>
<p>“Please let me go! Let me go home!”</p>
<p>“So now you think I’m your husband’s rival, don’t you? You think of me as the enemy of the Komoda family. Chiyoko, listen well. To me you are a most lovable woman. To the point where I think I’d like to die with you. But I can’t give up my dream. Do you know how much I suffered when I had to kill Hirosuke Hitomi and then give life to Genzaburō Komoda? Do you know how much I sacrificed to create my land of panoramas? When I think about it, I’d die if I were to abandon this island a month before it’s finished, and I just can’t bring myself to do it. And so I have no choice, Chiyoko, but to kill you!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Chiyoko raised her hoarse voice and screamed, “Don’t kill me! I’ll do whatever you say. I’ll treat you like Genzaburō as I’ve done up till now. I won’t say anything to anyone. Just don’t kill me!”</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>Hirosuke’s face was dyed blue in the light of the fireworks. His shining eyes glittered purple as he glared at Chiyoko as if to penetrate her.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, ha, ha! No, it’s not possible. It’s no good. You can say whatever you want. I can’t believe you. You might still love me just a bit. You might be telling the truth, but what proof do I have? If I let you live I’ll be destroyed. Even if you intend not to tell anyone, now that you’ve heard my confession, what guarantee is there that you won’t someday have the urge to reveal it? Your attitude will give it away. I have no choice but to kill you.”</p>
<p>“No! No! I have parents! I have brothers and sisters! Please spare me! For mercy’s sake! I’ll really do whatever you say, just like a puppet! Let me go! Let me go!”</p>
<p>“Look, I know that you’re attached to life. You don’t want to be my victim. You don’t love me. You loved only Genzaburō. No, even if you could love a man with the same face as Genzaburō’s, you could never love an evil man like me. I know that now. I have no choice but to kill you!”</p>
<p>Hirosuke gradually shifted the position of his arms away from Chiyoko’s shoulders and moved in on her neck.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaa, help …!!!”</p>
<p>Chiyoko was beside herself. She could think of nothing but to run away. The instinct of self-preservation passed down from her ancestors made her display her fangs like a gorilla. By reflex she sank her sharp canines deep into Hirosuke’s arm.</p>
<p>“You dirty bitch!”</p>
<p>Hirosuke could not help but release his grip. At that moment, with unimaginable speed, Chiyoko broke away from his grip and plunged into the water with the vigor of a seal, fleeing for the distant shore in the dark.</p>
<p>“Help! …”</p>
<p>Her earsplitting screams echoed among the surrounding hillocks.</p>
<p>“Fool! We’re in the mountains! Who’s going to come to save you? The women of the afternoon have returned to their underground quarters and are fast asleep, and you don’t even know the escape route.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke deliberately took his time closing in on her like a cat. As ruler of the kingdom he knew well there was no one above ground. The only thing that worried him a little was that her screams echoing down the cylinders of the fireworks might reach the underground far below, but luckily she had reached solid ground at the opposite end of the machinery that was used to produce the fireworks, and there the electric generator produced a dreadful noise so that a voice above ground could not be heard. What made him feel even safer was that at that very moment dozens of fireworks were being launched and the noise drowned out her screams.</p>
<p>The golden flames that had not disappeared lit up the pathetic figure of Chiyoko, who was running desperately in all directions in her attempts to find the exit and escape. In a single leap Hirosuke was on top of her and had no difficulty throwing her to the ground and getting his hands around her neck. Before she had a chance to scream again she was already struggling to breathe.</p>
<p>“Forgive me, please! I love you even now. But my desires are too great. I cannot renounce the pleasures of this island. I cannot ruin myself because of you!”</p>
<p>His tears fell, and as he cried out, “Forgive me! Forgive me!” he squeezed harder and harder. Under his body, flesh pressed against flesh and Chiyoko’s naked body flipped about like a fish caught in a net.</p>
<p>The naked bodies of the two people were entangled like two mad wild beasts bathed in the rainbow colors of the strange fireworks, in the odorous, lukewarm steam at the bottom of the valley of the artificial mountains covered with flowers. It was not a frightening murder; rather, it looked like the drunken nude dance of a man and a woman. An arm in pursuit. Skin trying to flee. At one point salty tears mingled on cheek pressed against cheek. Breast to breast heaved rhythmically together in a mad throbbing pulse, while rivulets of sticky sweat seemed to loosen two muddy bodies stuck together like sea slugs.</p>
<p>It felt more like a game than combat. If the expression “deadly play” existed, it would be correct to call it that. Both Hirosuke astride the belly of Chiyoko, whose slender throat he was squeezing, and Chiyoko writhing and gasping under the muscular man forgot all suffering and fell into rapturous pleasure and indescribable ecstasy.</p>
<p>Eventually Chiyoko’s pale fingers began to describe the beautiful curves of death agony, grasping repeatedly at air, as a threadlike stream of blood began to flow from her translucent nostrils.</p>
<p>At that very moment, as if it had been planned, the gigantic golden corolla of a firework that had just been launched punctuated the black velvet sky, and gold dust rained down upon the flower garden, the hot spring, and the two entangled bodies. Chiyoko’s pale face on which the thin thread of blood flowed as brilliant as red lacquer looked serenely beautiful.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>From that day on, Hirosuke Hitomi never returned to the Komoda residence in T City. As a resident of the land of the panoramas, and as the lord of this kingdom of folly, he would live forever on the island in the offing.</p>
<p>“Chiyoko is the queen of this land of the panoramas. Without doubt she’ll probably never reveal herself again to the world of human beings. You’ve probably seen the land of statues that exists on this island, haven’t you? There are times when Chiyoko becomes one of that grove of dazzling naked statues. And when not that, then a mermaid at the bottom of the sea, or a snake charmer in the land of the poisonous snakes. Or yet the spirit of the flowers that grow profusely in the flower garden. And when she grows tired of playing those games she’s again the splendid, majestic queen ensconced behind brocade curtains deep in the recesses of this splendid palace. Why shouldn’t she love this life of paradise? Drunk with the beauty of this land she forgets her home and loses her sense of time, the same as Urashima Tarō.1 You need not fret. Your dear mistress is now at the height of her happiness.”</p>
<p>When Chiyoko’s old governess fretted over the fate of her mistress and went to Okinoshima Island to try to find her, Hirosuke received her seated on a throne inside his magnificent palace that he had constructed underground and greeted her as one of his subjects with majestic ceremonials. This shocked the elderly, old-fashioned woman. Whether she was reassured by his beautiful words, or impressed by the pomp of the setting, she withdrew without saying anything.</p>
<p>Everything followed in the same fashion. There were generous gifts, one after another, for Chiyoko’s father, and economic pressures brought to bear on some of the members of her family, and unlimited gifts to other relatives, and bribes paid to the authorities. All these affairs were handled by old Tsunoda, who executed them without fail.</p>
<p>Moreover, no one on the island was permitted to have even a glimpse of the figure of the queen, Chiyoko.</p>
<p>She remained hidden during the day, as well as during the night, in the shadows of the heavy draperies in the back of Hirosuke’s room, deep in the recesses of the underground palace. All were forbidden to enter that room. Those who were aware of the eccentric tastes of their master assumed that the draperies hid a dreamworld of pleasures of which only the king and the queen could partake. They gossiped about it, snickering, and no one was the least suspicious. However, with the exception of a handful of men and women, none of the inhabitants of the island had seen Chiyoko’s face and would have had difficulty knowing whether or not it was the real Chiyoko even if they chanced to glimpse the queen in passing.</p>
<p>Thus was the practically impossible achieved.</p>
<p>Through utilizing the unlimited wealth of the Komoda family, Hirosuke surmounted all kinds of difficulties and managed to smooth everything over. The family members who up till then had lived in modest circumstances all of a sudden became wealthy and gained social status. Traveling circus dancers, movie actresses, and kabuki female impersonators who had been poor were warmly received and treated as the best artists in Japan. Young poets, painters, sculptors, and architects received allowances as lavishly as directors of small companies, so how could they muster the courage to abandon the island even if it was the land of a terrible crime? A paradise on earth had come into being.</p>
<p>A unique carnival madness began to seize the entire island. There were nude women blossoming in the flower gardens, hosts of mermaids madly disporting themselves in the warm pools, fireworks without end, groups of breathing statues, crazily dancing black monsters made of steel, drunken wild beasts that laughed, venomous snakes that danced; and gliding among all of these was a lotus throne made up of beautiful women, and on top of the lotus throne, the king of this land wrapped in a mantle of brocade, the crazy laughing face of Hitomi Hirosuke.</p>
<p>A large, round concrete pillar that had finally been erected and left standing in the center of the island was covered with green ivy that crawled over the entire surface. Weaving in and out of the ivy was a spiral staircase that wound like metal ivy to the top of the pillar. Sometimes the lotus throne also climbed up that spiral staircase to the top of the pillar.</p>
<p>From the summit, which was shaped like a fantastic mushroom cap, one could survey at a single glance the whole of the island as far as the breaking waves below, and the strangeness of that vista could not be likened to anything. The different scenes below receded as one ascended the winding staircase, and the flower gardens and the ponds and the people gave way, leaving in their place a wall of many layers of rock piled on top of each other. Seen from the top, that rose-colored rock wall looked like the petals of a single flower, overlapping down to the breaking waves far below.</p>
<p>After seeing the various fantastic sights, a visitor to Panorama Island would have had to gasp in amazement at this unsurpassable view. He would have had the impression that the entire island was a rose floating on the vast ocean and that the giant scarlet flower of an opium dream was conversing on an equal footing with the sun in the sky, just the two of them. What kind of strange beauty had that incomparable simplicity and grandeur created? Some travelers might have recalled the world of myth that their distant ancestors had seen….</p>
<p>How can the author describe the madness and debauchery, the pleasures of revelry and drunkenness, the numberless games of life and death that were played day and night on that magnificent stage? You readers might find something that resembled it, in part, in your most fantastic, bloodiest, and most beautiful nightmares.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Reader, should we here announce the happy ending of this fairy tale? Could Genzaburō Komoda, who was actually Hitomi Hirosuke, continue to immerse himself in the pleasures of this extraordinary land of panoramas like this until he was one hundred years old? No, no, not at all. After all, it’s the pattern in old-fashioned tales that right after the climax an intruder bearing a “catastrophe” is always on hand.</p>
<p>One day Hirosuke Hitomi was suddenly assailed by an indefinable anxiety. It may have been a case of the sadness experienced by the victor, or it may have been fatigue brought on by incessant pleasure. Or it might have been fear generated in the depths of his heart by his past evil deeds that stealthily assaulted him in his dreams when he dozed off. But in addition to all these reasons, was not the greatest cause of Hirosuke’s anxiety the strange, ominous quality of the air surrounding the man who had just arrived on the island?</p>
<p>“Who is that man lost in thought standing around over there by the pond? I don’t remember ever seeing him,” said he to a poet who was attending him when he discovered the man for the first time by the warm spring in the flower garden.</p>
<p>“Master, have you forgotten?” answered the poet. “He’s a man of letters, as we are. He’s one of those whom you hired at a later date. We haven’t seen him for a while because he returned home, but he probably came back on today’s steamer.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. What’s his name?”</p>
<p>“It was Kogoro Kitami.”</p>
<p>“Kogoro Kitami. I don’t recall the name at all.”</p>
<p>Couldn’t the fact that he strangely had no recollection of this man in itself have been a bad omen?</p>
<p>From then on, wherever he was, Hirosuke Hitomi felt the eye of the writer Kogoro Kitami on him. Whether it was amid the flowers in the flower garden, or on the other side of the vapors of the warm spring, or from the shadows of the cylinders in the land of machines, or in between the live statues in the garden of statues, or from the shade of the giant trees of the forest, Hirosuke had the impression that the other man was always watching his every move.</p>
<p>One day when he had had enough, Hirosuke accosted the man in the shadow of the huge pillar in the center of the island.</p>
<p>“Your name is Kogoro Kitami, right? Isn’t it strange that you should appear everywhere I go?”</p>
<p>The other, leaning casually against the pillar like a melancholy grade-school student, answered respectfully, his pale face blushing slightly, “It’s certainly accidental, Master.”</p>
<p>“Accidental? Yes, perhaps you’re right. But tell me, what were you thinking of just now?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking of a novel I read a long time ago. It was a novel that made a deep impression on me.”</p>
<p>“A novel? You are indeed a man of letters, aren’t you? But what novel was it and who wrote it?”</p>
<p>“Most probably you don’t know it. The author was unknown and it was never published. It’s a short novel titled ‘The Story of RA’ by Hirosuke Hitomi.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke had trained himself too well to be taken by surprise when all of a sudden he heard his old name spoken. Not a muscle in his face budged at the other’s unexpected words, and he went on conversing warmly even as he experienced a strange surge of joy at unexpectedly discovering a reader who admired his past writings.</p>
<p>“I know Hirosuke Hitomi. He was a man who wrote short novels that were much like fairy tales. He was one of my friends at the university, you know. I say friend but I never had an intimate conversation with him. I didn’t read ‘The Story of RA.’ How did you get ahold of that manuscript?”</p>
<p>“So he was one of your friends? How strange. ‘The Story of RA’ was written in l9—, but at that time you had already come back to T.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I had returned home. We’d parted for a good two years before that and I haven’t seen him since then. I knew that he wrote novels from having seen his name in magazine ads.”</p>
<p>“But as students you were not very close?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. We said hello when we saw each other in class, but that was about the extent of our relationship.”</p>
<p>“Up until the time I came here I was in the editorial department of K Magazine in Tokyo. It’s in this way that I got to know Mr. Hirosuke Hitomi and read his unpublished manuscript. I thought ‘The Story of RA’ was a true masterpiece. But the editor found certain sensuous descriptions in it too controversial, and he decided not to publish it. Moreover, Mr. Hitomi was still an unknown, novice writer at the time.”</p>
<p>“That’s a shame. What is Mr. Hitomi doing now?”</p>
<p>Hirosuke caught himself as he was about to add, “I could invite him to come to this island.” He was so sure of himself and his past misdeeds that he truly believed he had become Genzaburō Komoda.</p>
<p>“It seems that you’re not aware of it,” replied Kogoro Kitami, deeply moved. “He committed suicide last year.”</p>
<p>“Suicide?”</p>
<p>“He fell into the sea and died. We knew it was suicide because there was a suicide note.”</p>
<p>“Something bad must have happened to him.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps … although I don’t really know…. But what’s strange is that you and Mr. Hitomi resemble each other like twins. So much so that when I first came here I was surprised and asked myself if it wasn’t Mr. Hitomi hidden away in this place. Of course, you were also aware of this resemblance, weren’t you, Master?”</p>
<p>“We were often teased about it. You know that God sometimes plays tremendous jokes on us.”</p>
<p>Hitomi exploded into laughter. Kogoro Kitami echoed his laughter as if he too found it unbearably funny.</p>
<p>That very day the sky was covered with gray rain clouds. It was unpleasantly still, as before a storm, while around the island the foam-crested waves roared like beasts.</p>
<p>The big, shadowless pillar soared straight up toward the low-hanging, black clouds like a devil’s staircase, and at its huge base measuring five spans two small human beings talked quietly with one another. Hitomi was usually either riding the lotus throne of naked women or surrounded by many servants. But on that particular day he was all alone talking for a long time with Kogoro Kitami, who was nothing but an employee. It was stranger than strange.</p>
<p>“You resemble one another completely, you know. And there’s another unusual resemblance,” Kogoro Kitami continued tenaciously.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by unusual resemblance?” Hitomi asked. He couldn’t bring himself to end the conversation.</p>
<p>“It’s about the novel ‘The Story of RA’ that I mentioned. You never heard about the novel’s plot from Hitomi, Master?”</p>
<p>“No, never. As I told you, Hitomi was never more than a classmate. I saw him in class, but we never had a real conversation.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“You’re a strange one. I have no reason to lie.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want to stand on that statement? Aren’t you going to regret it later?”</p>
<p>Hitomi couldn’t help shivering as he heard Kitami’s strange warning. It was as though he had overlooked something essential but for some strange reason could not remember what it was.</p>
<p>“What on earth do you …?” Hitomi started to say, but stopped at once. Slowly he started to understand. His face turned pale. His breathing quickened and he felt something cold running down his armpits.</p>
<p>“So, you see, you start to understand. Why do you think I came to this island?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t understand. I don’t understand what you’re saying at all. I beg you to stop this insane talk.”</p>
<p>Hitomi laughed again. But his laughter had no force; it was like the laugh of a ghost.</p>
<p>“If you don’t understand, I’ll tell you.”</p>
<p>Little by little Kitami lost the reserve of a servant.</p>
<p>“Several scenes in the novel ‘The Story of RA’ are exactly the same as the various landscapes on this island, just as you’re the living replica of Hitomi. How did this strange coincidence come about if you hadn’t read Hiromi’s novel or heard about it? Don’t you think it’s too neat to be just a coincidence? The creation of this island of panoramas could not have occurred if the maker were not someone who had the exact same interests and ideas as the author of ‘The Story of RA.’ You may look like Hirosuke Hitomi, but it’s hard to believe that you’d also think like him. That’s what I was thinking a moment ago.”</p>
<p>“But what are you driving at?” Hirosuke held his breath and glared at his interlocutor’s face.</p>
<p>“You still don’t understand? All right. You’re not Genzaburō Komoda. You’re none other than Hirosuke Hitomi. If you had said that you had read or heard about ‘The Story of RA,’ you could have created those scenes on the island by imitating the story and you would have convinced me. You’ve blocked your one path of escape, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>Hirosuke understood then that he had fallen into a clever trap set by Kitami.</p>
<p>Before launching this undertaking, he had checked his literary works to make sure that he had left nothing behind that was compromising, but he didn’t think of the manuscripts that had not been published. He had almost even forgotten that he had written a novel entitled “The Story of RA.” That was because, as I explained at the beginning of this tale, he was a pathetic writer who had one manuscript after another rejected.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to what Kitami had just finished telling him, he remembered having written such a novel. Because the construction of a man-made landscape had been a dream of his for many years, it was not the least bit strange that the dream should have become a novel on the one hand, or on the other hand that it should have manifested itself as an actual thing not a whit different from the novel. Thus, there had been a slipup in the plan that had taken him so long to develop. What he regretted more than anything was that this error was due to a manuscript that had not even been accepted for publication.</p>
<p>“I’m done for. He’s seen through me. But no, wait! All this guy has in his hand is a single novel. Let’s not get discouraged so quickly. Just because the landscapes on this island resemble the ones in a novel someone has written does not constitute evidence of a crime.”</p>
<p>Hitomi at once took hold of himself and recovered his calm.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, ha, ha! You’re a man who spends a lot of energy on little things, aren’t you? You firmly believe that I’m Hirosuke Hitomi? It doesn’t bother me in the least. It doesn’t matter what you think, because I’m none other than Genzaburō Komoda.”</p>
<p>“You’re greatly mistaken if you think I have no other evidence. I know everything. But I took this indirect way to make you confess. I have my reasons for not having the police intervene right away. I admire your art very much, even though I’ve been called upon by Countess Higashikōji, and I don’t want to see that great talent prosecuted by the law.”</p>
<p>“So you’ve been sent by Higashikōji?”</p>
<p>Hiromi finally understood. Of the entire family, only Count Higashikōji, to whom Genzaburō’s younger sister was married, could not be bribed with money, and Kogoro Kitami was at the service of his wife.</p>
<p>“Indeed. I came here at the behest of the Countess Higashikōji. You’re probably surprised that the wife of Higashikōji, who had practically no contact with her family in the country, has had you under surveillance from afar.”</p>
<p>“No, what surprises me is that she distrusts me. If she’d only meet with me to talk, she’d understand right away.”</p>
<p>“Is that worth mentioning now? ‘The Story of RA’ only served to trigger my suspicions. The real proofs lie elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m listening.”</p>
<p>“Well, for example …”</p>
<p>“For example?”</p>
<p>“For example, this hair sticking out of the concrete wall.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Kogoro Kitami parted the ivy that covered the surface of the enormous tower to show him a long hair growing out of the white concrete like an udonge flower.1</p>
<p>“You must know what this means … oh, no you don’t! Look, my bullet will leave this gun before your finger touches the trigger.”</p>
<p>Kitami thrust forward something shiny that he held in his right hand. Hirosuke froze with his hand in his pocket and could not move.</p>
<p>“For some time now, I’ve continued to think about this one hair. And while I was talking with you I was at last about to get at the truth. I was able to confirm that it’s not just one isolated hair but part of something that’s inside the wall. Shall we try to verify it now?”</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, Kogoro Kitami took up a big pickaxe with a pointed end that he had brought along and started to swing it with all his strength, aiming for a spot a little below the place where the hair appeared. He continued striking until the hard concrete cracked and a hole opened up. Then heavy, half-coagulated blood started to run down along the pickaxe. It flowed thickly, no doubt from the heart of the dead beauty, and a brilliantly colored peony blossomed on the white surface of the concrete.</p>
<p>“No need to dig any more. A human corpse is hidden in this tower. It’s the body of your wife, or rather, the wife of Genzaburō Komoda.”</p>
<p>While restraining with one arm Hirosuke, who had turned pale as a ghost and was about to sit down, Kitami continued talking in a normal tone of voice.</p>
<p>“Of course, I didn’t guess everything from this single hair. I realized that it was the existence of Komoda’s wife that must have posed the greatest obstacle to Hirosuke Hitomi’s becoming Genzaburō Komoda. And while I was carefully observing your relationship with her she suddenly disappeared. You succeeded in misleading others, but not me. I knew beyond a doubt that you had killed the wife. Since you killed her, you had to find a spot to hide the body. Now, what sort of spot would someone like you choose …?</p>
<p>“Luckily for me, you probably forgot about it, but this hiding place was mentioned in ‘The Story of RA.’</p>
<p>“In that novel a man named RA who has abnormal tastes erects a large, concrete pillar. He imitates an old legend about the building of a bridge and gratuitously buries a woman alive in the concrete as a human pillar. (As it’s a novel, murder can be committed freely.)</p>
<p>“Acting on a hunch, when I found out the date on which the wife came to this island, I learned that she had come precisely at the time when the pillar casing was finished and you began to pour concrete into it. It’s really a secure hiding place, isn’t it? You just waited for the time when there was nobody around, then lifted her body up to the top of the scaffolding and slid her down inside. Then all you had to do was pour two or three pails of cement down on her.</p>
<p>“But one of her hairs got tangled and stuck out from the concrete. An unanticipated slipup in your crime.”</p>
<p>Hirosuke was already crumbling, leaning his head against the pillar on the very spot where Chiyoko’s blood had appeared. While looking sympathetically at his miserable appearance, Kogoro Kitami pressed on, determined to say what he had on his mind.</p>
<p>“In other words, you see, you absolutely had to kill the wife because you were not Genzaburō Komoda. Do you understand? The wife’s body is one of the proofs I mentioned a while ago.</p>
<p>“Of course, that’s not the only thing. I have another proof, a more significant proof. You probably know what I mean. It’s to be found in the cemetery of the Komoda family temple.</p>
<p>“Seeing that a corpse had disappeared from the grave and that a live man who looked exactly like Genzaburō Komoda had shown up in a different place, the people at once believed that Komoda had been resuscitated. But when a corpse has disappeared from a casket, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it came back to life, because it might be that the corpse was transported to another place. As a number of caskets are buried in another spot nearby, if the person who disinterred the corpse were trying to hide it, there’d be no better place than the casket in the adjoining grave.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a clever trick? Genzaburō’s grandfather’s coffin is buried next to Genzaburō Komoda’s grave. It’s thanks to your thoughtful good offices that the grandfather and the grandson are now sleeping next to each other, their bones intertwined.”</p>
<p>When Kogoro Kitami had gotten this far, Hirosuke Hitomi, who had collapsed, suddenly jumped up and howled a horrible laugh.</p>
<p>“Aha! You’ve investigated it thoroughly, haven’t you? You figured it out exactly, to a T. But to tell the truth, there was no need to trouble a fine detective such as yourself. I was already on the brink of ruin. It was only a question of time. For a moment I was surprised and tried to resist you, but now I’ve thought it over, I realize I’d only be able to prolong my life of pleasure by a month or half a month. What good would that do? I’ve already created what I wanted to create and done what I wanted to do. I have no regrets. So I’ll happily return to being Hirosuke Hitomi and follow your orders. To confess, there’s nothing left of the Komodas’ wealth but enough funds to sustain this lifestyle for another month. But you said a while ago that you don’t want a man like me to be judged by the law. What did you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Hearing you talk this way, I’m more than satisfied…. What did I mean? Well, that I wanted this to be settled once and for all without resorting to the hands of the police. This is not an order of the Countess Higashikōji. This is my personal wish as a servant devoted to art.”</p>
<p>“Well, let me thank you in turn. Can you please allow me to remain free for a little time longer? All I need is half an hour.”</p>
<p>“Of course. There are several hundred persons who are your servants on this island. If they found out that you’re a dangerous criminal they certainly wouldn’t take your part. And you probably won’t try to muster allies and break the promise you just made to me. Where should I wait for you?”</p>
<p>“At the warm spring pond in the flower garden,” said Hirosuke before disappearing behind the enormous concrete pillar.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Kogoro Kitami found himself again half-immersed in the warm waters of the basin, serenely inhaling its sweet-smelling vapors in the midst of the nude women as he waited peacefully for Hirosuke to come.</p>
<p>The sky was still covered with heavy black clouds. There was no wind, and as far as he could see the flower-covered mountains were as in a silvery sleep. There wasn’t the slightest movement on the water. Even the dozens of nude women bathing in the warm water were dead silent. In Kitami’s eye the entire scene looked very much like a brocade picture with a melancholy cast.</p>
<p>The ten or twenty minutes that went by seemed to last forever. The immobile sky, the flower-covered mountains, the dark pool, the nude women, and the dreamy gray that enveloped it all.</p>
<p>But, by and by, people were suddenly recalled to themselves by an unexpected sound of fireworks that were sent up from the corner of the pond. The instant they looked at the sky, a scream of admiration went up at the extraordinary beauty of the light that blossomed there.</p>
<p>Those fireworks were at least five times larger than the usual ones. They filled the whole sky, not with one flower but with a host of the multicolored petals of a mixed bouquet as if viewed through a kaleidoscope, changing shape and color as they descended, spreading wider and wider.</p>
<p>Unlike the night fireworks and different from the fireworks of the day, the multicolored lights became strangely frosted against the silvery background and black clouds. The appearance of the five-colored lights gradually descending, moment by moment, like a suspended ceiling as they spread out over the sky was truly a sight to vanquish one’s soul.</p>
<p>At that moment, Kogoro Kitami, under the blinding multicolored lights, suddenly saw bright red droplets appear on the faces and shoulders of several of the nude women.</p>
<p>At first he took it for a reflection of the fireworks on the drops of vapor and ignored it. But soon the scarlet splashes rained down more and more heavily, and he felt them on his own forehead and cheeks. They felt strangely warm, and when he touched them, he realized that the scarlet droplets were no other than drops of human blood. And when he looked closely at something floating on the surface of the water in front of him, he realized it was a horribly mutilated human hand that had fallen there without his being aware of it.</p>
<p>In the midst of this bloody spectacle, Kogoro Kitami, wondering at the strange calm of the naked women around him, remained immobile, resting his head on the edge of the basin, lost in contemplation of the hand floating close to his chest, its scarlet wound open like a flower.</p>
<p>And thus, Hirosuke’s body was pulverized into fragments along with the fireworks and turned into a rain of blood and flesh that poured down on every nook and cranny of the land of panoramas that he had created.</p>

To cite a few examples, doubles and doppelgängers appear in Tanizaki’s “The Story of Tomoda and Matsunaga” (Tomoda to Matsunaga no hanashi, 1926); Satō Haruo’s “The Fingerprint” (Shimon, 1918); and Uno Kōji’s “The Two Aoki Aisaburōs” (Futari no Aoki Aisaburō, 1926). Obsessions created by cinematic and photographic images are dramatized in Akutagawa’s “One-Sided Love” (Katakoi, 1917) and “Shadow” (Kage, 1920); Uno Kōji’s “Dream Room” (Yume miru heya, 1923); and Tanizaki’s “A Fool’s Love” (Chijin no ai, 1924; translated as “Naomi”) and “Mr. Aozuka’s Story” (Aozuka shi no hanashi, 1926; translated as “Mr. Bluemound”). Takahashi Seori mentions other earlier writers, such as Ozaki Kōyō and Kōda Rohan, whose stories of strange worlds removed from reality were influenced by their keen interest in optical mechanisms. “Renzu shikake no retorikku” (The Rhetoric of Lens Mechanisms), in Ranpo no Jidai (The Age of Ranpo), Bessatsu Taiyō (Special Edition of Sun), ed.

Arnold and Erica Pomerans (The Hague: Waanders Publishers, 1996), 25.</p>
<p>6. Bernard Comment emphasizes the sense of control that the panorama gave the city dweller: “The invention of the panorama was a response to a particularly strong nineteenth-century need—for absolute dominance. It gave individuals the happy feeling that the world was organized around and by them, yet this was a world from which they were also separated and protected, for they were seeing it from a distance. A double dream came true—one of totality and of possession; encyclopaedism on the cheap.” The Painted Panorama (New York: Harry A. Abrams, 2000), 19.</p>
<p>7. Invented by Robert Barker in England in the late eighteenth century, the panorama remained popular in Europe and the United States throughout the nineteenth century. In contrast, in Japan the panorama boom lasted only about fifteen years, from the time of its introduction in 1890 to the time it was supplanted by motion pictures shortly after the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>8. The Boshin War (1868–1869) was the last military encounter between supporters of the Tokugawa shogunate and the imperial forces. It resulted in the final defeat of shogunal forces.</p>

<p>12. In one of the most popular foreign films of the Taishō period, The Student of Prague (1913), special camera effects were used to make the innocent student and his evil doppelgänger, played by the same actor, appear in the scene simultaneously. Ranpo evokes the terrifying way that film can distort the appearance of the human face in his 1926 essay, “Eiga no kyōfu” (The Terrors of Film): “Looking at motion pictures terrifies me. They are an opium addict’s dream. From a one-inch frame of film come giants that fill a theater. They cry, they laugh, they get angry, and fall in love. Phantoms from the kingdom of giants described by Swift unfold vividly before the eyes. A huge face, a thousand times bigger than my own, fills the screen and looks at me and laughs. What if it were my own face!” Edogawa Ranpo zenshū. Oni no kotoba (Collected Works of Edogawa Ranpo. Words of the Demon), vol. 16 (Tokyo: Kodansha, 1978), 41.</p>
<p>13. In “Waga seishun no eiga henreki” (A Record of the Movies of My Youth), Ranpo writes about the excitement generated by the Zigomar films. He recalls the benshi who accompanied the shows, a thin mysterious man with a Mephistophelian look who dramatically flapped the sleeves of his black Inverness cape; Edogawa Ranpo zenshū Waga yume to shinjitsu (Collected Works of Edogawa Ranpo, My Dream and Reality), vol. 22 (Tokyo: Kodansha, 1978), 141–143. Public interest in crime when Ranpo wrote was keen. Magazines such as Hanzai kagaku (Criminology) and Hanzai kōron (Public Review of Crime) were devoted to articles on crime, and a keen public debate on the subject was carried out in the newspapers.

<p>27. Okamura Tomio points out that the technology for constructing a glass undersea tunnel was first used in aquariums in Japan in the late twentieth century. One such tunnel now exists in Toba City in Mie Prefecture, the model for T City in M Prefecture in the novel (“ ‘Panoramato kidan’ ron aruiwa Ranpo no hanashi,” 186).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 1</p>
<p>1. In 1917 Ranpo was employed by Suzuki Shoten company, which founded the Toba Dockyard Co., Ltd., located in Toba City, Mie Prefecture. The Mikimoto Pearl Island (formerly known as Aijima Island) is said to have been the model for the island of the story.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2</p>
<p>1. Utopian literature had been in vogue since the Meiji period, when many utopian writings by Western authors were introduced into Japan. In addition, prominent public figures such as Miyazawa Kenji (1896–1933) and Kagawa Toyohiko (1888–1960) were involved in the creation of utopian communities. One of the most famous of these was Atarashiki mura (New Village), founded by Mushanokōji Saneatsu (1885–1976) in 1918. For accounts of Japanese utopian literature and the utopian experiment of Mushanokōji, see Yoriko Moichi, “Japanese Utopian Literature from the l870s to the Present and the Influence of Western Utopianism,” Utopian Studies 10.2 (Spring 1999): 89–97, and Angelia Yiu, “From Utopia to Empire: Atarashikimura and a Personal View of the Greater East Asia War (1942),” Utopian Studies 19.2 (Spring 2008): 213–232.</p>
<p>2. William Morris (1834–1896) was the English author of Utopia: News from Nowhere (1890), a classic utopian work advocating utopian socialism sustained by agriculture and handicrafts. Morris was also well known as an architect, furniture and textile designer, artist, and writer associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the English Arts and Crafts Movement.</p>
<p>3. Etienne Cabet (1788–1856) was a French philosopher, utopian socialist, and author of the utopian novel Voyage en Icarie (1848), which portrayed an ideal society influenced by communist ideals. Ikaria is a majestic island in the eastern Aegean Sea, named after Ikaros (Icarus), the son who, seized by the thrill of flying, ignored his father’s warning and fell into the sea after flying too close to the sun.</p>
<p>4. “The Domain of Arnheim” (1847), an expansion of Poe’s earlier “The Landscape Garden” (1842), was translated into Japanese by Tanizaki Jun’ichirō and was likely the inspiration for Panoramato kidan. In the Poe story a creative genius inherits a massive fortune from a relative and uses the gift to realize a fantasy landscape, using the elements of nature to create on land the way an artist uses paint to give shape to his vision on canvas. Numerous scenes of the highly artificial landscapes in Panoramato kidan are reminiscent of scenes from “The Domain of Arnheim.”</p>
<p>5. The Epang Palace was built by the first emperor of the Chin dynasty in 212 B.C. Located west of the present-day city of Xi’an, it was one of early China’s major construction projects, and its erection is said to have required the labor of seven hundred thousand men.</p>
<p>6. The Asuka era (ca. A.D. 552–646) was an early era in Japanese history when numerous architectural and sculptural wonders from the Asian continent were introduced into Japan.</p>
<p>7. The Golden Pavilion (Kinkakuji) was a sumptuous villa in Kyoto created as a religious retreat by the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in the late fourteenth century. The Silver Pavilion (Ginkakuji), also in Kyoto, was built by the later shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa. Both structures are associated with the brilliant artistic achievements of the Muromachi period (ca. 1338–1573).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4</p>
<p>1. Franz Hartmann (1838–1912) was a German-American physician and occultist who wrote “Premature Burial: An Examination into the Occult Causes of Apparent Death, Trance, and Catalepsy” in 1895.</p>
<p>2. Eugene Bouchut (1818–1891) was a French physician who wrote “Traité des signes de la mort et des moyens de prévenir les enterrements prématurés” (Treatise on the Signs of Death and Ways of Preventing Premature Burial). He is said to have been the first doctor to use a stethoscope to ascertain the state of a corpse.</p>
<p>3. Friederike Kempner (1836–1904) was a Silesian poet and author of the pamphlet Denkschrift über die Nothwendigkeit einer Gesetzlichen Einführung von Leichenhäusem (Essays on the Necessity of the Legal Introduction of Crematories, 1853), which called attention to the dangers of premature burial. Through her extensive research and writing she became known as an expert on the issue of premature burial, a topic that fascinated many toward the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>4. The problem of accidental premature burial apparently haunted Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849). In the essay “A Premature Burial” (1844) he describes instances of live burial and discusses catalepsy and the danger of being mistaken for dead and buried while in a cataleptic state.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 15</p>
<p>1. The Warring States period, or Sengoku, lasted from approximately 1482 to 1558. During this time the rule of the central government was displaced by regional control exercised by powerful daimyō war chiefs.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 19</p>
<p>1. Public interest in Manchuria was high when Panoramato kidan was serialized in Shinseinen magazine from October 1926 to April 1927. Japanese citizens had been encouraged to emigrate and cultivate the land in Manchuria at the time of the Sino-Japanese War in the 1890s, and by 1931 a quarter of a million Japanese lived there. The vastness of the continent in itself may be said to have constituted a panoramic spectacle for the Japanese public, who were treated to views of it through newsreels and photographs. Kanako Tsutomu, “Kaiki naru jinkō fūkei. Ranpo no panoramato kidan o megutte” (A Strange Artificial Landscape. On Ranpo’s “Strange Tale of Panorama Island), Tokushū Edogawa Ranpo no miryoku—tanjō hyakunen (Special Issue: The Centennial of Edogawa Ranpo’s Appeal), Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō (December 1994): 65–69.</p>
<p>2. Credit for the invention of the panorama is usually given, not to a Frenchman (i.e., Louis Daguerre, the inventor of the diorama) as Ranpo’s narrator claims, but to the Irish painter Robert Barker (1739–1806) at the end of the eighteenth century. Barker is also said to have coined the term “panorama.” The first panorama in Japan was built in Ueno Park at the time of the Third National Industrial Exposition in 1890. Following the erection of Panorama Hall (panoramakan) in the Asakusa entertainment district half a year later, panoramas were created at a number of sites in Japan in rapid succession. Okamura Tomio, “Panoramato kidan ron aruiwa Ranpo no hanashi” (On the Strange Tale of Panorama Island, or Ranpo’s Story), in Edogawa Ranpo to taishū no nijū seiki (Edogawa Ranpo and the Twentieth Century of the Masses), ed. Fujii Hidetada, Kokubungaku kaishaku to kanshō, bessatsu, 2004, p. 184. The effect of panoramic viewing is also a feature of the descriptions of the artificially perfect landscapes in “The Domain of Arnheim.”</p>
<p>3. In 1923, while working for the advertising department of Osaka mainichi shinbun, Ranpo designed a Land of Machines (kikaikoku) for an ad. His vivid visual and spatial imagination and talent for graphic design were also manifest in the drawing of satirical manga (Okamura Tomio, ibid., p. 187).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 20</p>
<p>1. Yoshino, located in the Yoshino Mountains in western Japan, is the site of some one hundred thousand cherry trees dating back to the seventh century. The blossoming groves that draw many visitors in April have been celebrated in Japanese poetry for centuries.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 23</p>
<p>1. Urashima Tarō is Japan’s version of the Rip Van Winkle story. Urashima Tarō travels to the underwater palace of the Sea King on the back of a turtle, forgets about time, and discovers that he is an old man when he eventually returns to his home village.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 24</p>
<p>1. Udonge (Udumbara) is a plant that is said to flower once in three thousand years.</p>
