<p>Editor’s Introduction</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous and oft told tales of horror in Japan, the Yotsuya kaidan tells of a young woman named Iwa and the curse she carried out after her death against those who had wronged her in life. For nearly three hundred years in the repertoire of itinerant storytellers, in dramatic performances on stage, and in modern adaptations for anime and film, Iwa’s story has lost none of its intoxicating power over the imagination. Its reception outside of Japan has depended by and large on a single English translation made in 1916, whose literary eccentricities have kept it from the wider readership it deserves. Just over a hundred years on, it seems only right to revise the text for overall readability in the hope of securing its place among the classics of world literature.</p>
<p>the history of the text</p>
<p>The version of the Yotsuya kaidan presented in this volume is based on a Kabuki play known as the Tōkaidō yotsuya kaidan, first performed in 1825. The author, Tsururya Nanboku (1755–1829), was a leading playwright in late Edo-period Japan. It is his name that has come to be associated with the story of Iwa’s curse.</p>
<p>Recent research, however, has determined that the original story dates back to around 1727 with the underground publication of a work entitled Yotsuya zōtan. The work is presented as a documentary based on an inside account by an official of Yotsuya Ward, where the events are said to have taken place. A mixture of hearsay and fact, the story centers on a series of scandals involving three established Tokugawa families: the Tamiya, the Itō, and the Akiyama. According to rumors circulating at the time, the ghastly punishments meted out to the guilty parties were the work of the ghost of Tamiya Iwa, the victim of their conspiracy. The evidence available in public records regarding names and places supports the claims that there is a solid core of truth behind the rumors in the Yotsuya zōtan. The fascinating but hazy borderline between the actual events that took place in Yotsuya Ward and their imaginary telling has inspired an entire genre of works from the Edo period down to our own times.</p>
<p>The version presented here is drawn from the notes of a Rakugo storyteller’s performance published in 1896 as Yotsuya kaidan. The raconteur, Shunkintei Ryūō (1826–1894), was a celebrated representative of the art of Rakugo in the early years of the Meiji era. His skill at presenting the tales was such that it is said to have frightened people away from the theater. The scholarly consensus today is that his version of the story is more clearly based on the original Yotsuya zōtan than on Nanboku’s later adaptation for Kabuki. </p>
<p>Ryūō, like his predecessors, had his text recorded in a Japanese imitation of Western shorthand rather than prepared for publication in standard Japanese literary form. This meant that it needed to be transcribed before it could be published, which in turn required some adjustment in grammar and some conjecture in the choice of Chinese characters, even with the help of the Yotsuya zōtan and Nanboku’s script. The shorthand version no longer seems to be extant. </p>
<p>In short, the Yotsuya kaidan has come down to us in three principal forms:</p>
<p>It was from the published text of Ryūō’s story that James S. de Benneville, an American scholar of Japanese culture living in Yokohama at the time, prepared an English translation for publication in 1917 under the title The Yotsuya Kwaidan or O’Iwa Inari: Tales of the Tokugawa. Numerous additions and glosses in the English not present in the original Japanese make it clear that other versions of the story were also consulted. In any case, the revised edition that is presented here is based entirely on the translation published under de Benneville’s name.</p>
<p>summaries of the legend</p>
<p>The protagonist of the tale is a woman named Tamiya Iwa. In Ryūō’s version, her personal name is given as O-Iwa, and indeed the names of all the women that appear are fitted out with the same prefix. The convention is superfluous in English but is helpful in Japanese, especially in oral presentation. Simply put, the prefix “O” is linguistically fluid. It can be used like a diminutive to indicate affection; it can serve as an honorific in polite forms of address; or it can be used to distinguish a name from the literal meaning of a word. The latter is the case with Iwa, whose pronunciation is synonymous with “rock,” as also with Mino (straw raincoat), Hana (flower), Taki (waterfall), Matsu (pine tree), and the numerous other women who figure in the story. The same principle holds true for references to Iwa as an obake. By itself, bake simply connotes “changing shape,” but with the addition of the prefix “o,” it is understood to denote a demonic ghost.</p>
<p>Iwa, the deformed daughter of an already unsightly mother, is betrothed to a scheming, degenerate husband who conspires with others to sell her into service as a prostitute. On learning the facts, she pronounces a curse on all those involved in the plot, after which she appears to commit suicide by throwing herself into a sewage canal. She resurrects in a hideous form to haunt the perpetrators and deceive them into destroying the ones they love. </p>
<p>Such, in brief outline, is the story as Ryūō tells it. A French edition of Nanboku’s text, Les spectres de Yotsuya, was published in 1979 by Jeanne Sigée, who was given access to the world of Kabuki by the illustrious scholar Gunji Masakatsu. Her summation of the story is worth quoting to demonstrate the contrast between the versions of Nanboku and Ryūō:</p>
<p>According to rumors circulating after the Genroku era, O-Iwa, the daughter of a certain Tamiya—a subordinate constable in the shogunate guard living in the Yotsuya Ward of Samon-chō—was tricked by her husband Iemon and their go-between Akiyama Chōemon, who then killed her for her jealousy. Her spiteful ghost returned to torment them. A sanctuary in the ward was dedicated to each of the spouses, who are still the object of great veneration today, particularly by those who are badgered into performing this remarkable piece of theater.1</p>
<p>Two things are worth noting in the above resume. First, the wrathful spirit of Iwa enshrined in the sanctuary is still alive and continues to hound the theatrical world to stage the play. Needless to say, this may be no more than an advertising ruse dating from Nanboku’s time. Second, it is the jealousy of Iwa, the lady of Tamiya, that got her killed and transformed her into an avenging ghost. Sigée’s emphasis on jealousy as a psychological rationale for Iwa’s actions may be only part of the picture. Ryūō’s tale obliges us to look more deeply into her motivations. Consider, for example, the way de Benneville introduces the legend:</p>
<p>O-Iwa, the Lady of Tamiya, really did exist in the Genroku and Hōei periods (1688–1711); just ante-dating the reforming rule of the eighth Tokugawa Shōgun, Yoshimune. Victim of an atrocious plot of her husband and others, she committed suicide with the vow to visit her rage upon all engaged in the conspiracy. The shrine of the O-Iwa Inari (Fox-witched O-Iwa) in Yotsuya was early erected (1717) to propitiate her wrathful ghost; and the shrines of Nippon, to the shabbiest and meanest, have their definite record.2</p>
<p>Yotsuya O-Iwa-inari Tamiya Shrine in Samon-chō </p>
<p>Clearly de Benneville is sufficiently sensitive to the religious elements in the background to highlight the Tamiya’s enshrinement of the Inari deity in Yotsuya for the purpose of placating Iwa’s spirit. To follow up on his apparent allusion to other Shinto and Buddhist sites dedicated to calming her anger, we may mention the following shrines and temples still active:</p>
<p>As is not uncommon in Japan, Iwa is enshrined as a Shinto deity and, at the same time, commemorated in Buddhist temples. All of them have become pilgrimage sites popular with tourists. Ryūō has taken credit for erecting a gravestone to her in Myōkō-ji at the end of the nineteenth century, but this may also have been no more than a bit of the same showmanship we suspected Nanboku of engaging in.</p>
<p>The supernatural dimension of the legends swirling around the ghost of Iwa is also apparent in the superstitious fears of the publisher, as we shall see presently. Still more to the point is the postface to Ryūō’s text, in which Tada Seiken, the famous novelist of detective stories, recalls his conversation with the publisher.</p>
<p>The protagonist is a wise and chaste woman whose uncommon virtue and grace earned her the respect of men and women for succeeding generations.… The publisher told me, “Given the uniquely miraculous nature of the Inari shrine in Yotsuya, should anyone make a ghost story out of it, that person would inevitably be met with the divine ire of Inari. In fact, no sooner had another publisher in Tokyo produced a book on the matter last year than it pulled it out of circulation for fear of incurring divine punishment. Since then, no one has dared published anything of the sort.3</p>
<p>De Benneville took this into account when offering his own explanation of why an Inari shrine was built on Tamiya family property after the events in question: Because she was such an uncommonly virtuous woman and had such a deep faith in the Inari deity, her anger transcended the realm of the human into the divine. </p>
<p>The publisher concurred on this point, fearing that if the deity were not respected and the story were not told truthfully, those involved would suffer her divine wrath.4 In this sense, the very printing and dissemination of the legend had an important part to play in appeasing her spirit and presenting her as an avatar of the Inari deity. It also explains why written accounts of the story came to overshadow the oral tradition.</p>
<p>Iwa's grave at Myōgyō-ji temple</p>
<p>the religious dimension of the legend</p>
<p>There are two versions of the original documentary novel, Yotsuya zōtan, still available. Their content is not the same, and each of them has been reprinted with modifications:</p>
<p>Yotsuya zōtan: Kinko jitsuroku 『四ツ谷雑談：今古実録』 [Yotsuya zōtan: Actual Records Old and New] (Tokyo: Eisensha, 1884). National Diet Library Digital Collections.</p>
<p>Yotsuya kaidan (Yotsuya zōtan) 『四谷怪談（四谷雑談）』, in 『近世実録全書第』 (Tokyo: Waseda University Press, 1929), vol. 4.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two modern translations of the work:</p>
<p>「四谷雑談集」, trans. and ed. by Takada Mamoru 高田 衛, in 『日本怪談集 江戸編』 [Collected Ghost Stories of Japan: Edo Tales] (Kawade Bunko, 1992).</p>
<p>『四ッ谷雑談集』, trans. and annotated by Hirosaka Tomonobu 広坂朋信, in 『実録 四谷怪談：現代語訳』 [Actual Records: A Modern Translation of the Yotsuya kaidan ] (Tokyo: Hakutakusha, 2013).</p>
<p>Konita Seiji argues that most documentary novels in the genre treat religious beliefs in the power of sacred Buddhist texts or veneration of the wisdom and virtue of Buddhist saints in similar fashion. Nevertheless, it seems strange that the spirit of Iwa never comes finally to rest and that the Yotsuya zōtan reaches no religious resolution in that regard.5 In a detail omitted from the edition presented here, Iemon fathers five children with his new wife after Iwa’s disappearance and has to call in doctors to deal with the variety of mortal diseases that afflict them. In no case does he seem to attribute this to Iwa’s vengeance, despite her appearances at the loss of his children. Despite the primitive state of medical science at the time, Iemon prefers the rational explanations of the doctors to thinking that there is anything remotely religious about their fate. According to Konita, this highlights the “irrelevance of the religious dimension” in the Yotsuya zōtan.</p>
<p>In contrast, Ryūō’s text of one hundred and seventy years later is constructed more along the lines of a Buddhist instructional tale. In the final chapter, he makes it clear that the purpose of his performance is to commemorate Iwa’s death, the same motivation that appears in Seiken’s discussion with the publisher. This is the reason he gives for restoring her grave site in Myōkō-ji and seeing that she gets a proper burial. His rationale for telling the story implies an obligation to carry on with placating her spirit in order to avoid further retribution from the gods. In this regard, it is not unlike the ancient Greek tragedy of Iphigenia in Aulis, where the sacrifice of Agamemnon’s daughter to the god Artemis was required to calm the seas. It is the same rationale given for disseminating his Yotsuya kaidan in print.</p>
<p>Does this suggest that the audience Ryūō had in mind at the beginning of the Meiji era was more superstitious than they would have been in the late Edo period? Did they believe in Iwa’s curse and trust more in miraculous solutions than in rational explanation? We would do well to have a brief look at the history of Rakugo performances in order better to understand the modernization of the Japanese ghosts.</p>
<p>the origins of rakugo in the edo period</p>
<p>Rakugo is the art of storytelling ranging from comedy and melodrama to tales of horror. It is performed solo on stage, seated on a cushion, with the aid of a folding fan for dramatic effect.6 Research has shown that its roots trace back to two sources in the Edo period. </p>
<p>The first is from the tradition of Buddhist instructional sermons. In a study of Pure Land Buddhist sermons, Sekiyama Kazuo points out numerous terms and rhetorical devices imported into Edo Rakugo. In fact, several Rakugo performances can be shown to have derived directly from the texts of Buddhist sermons. Moreover, Anrakuan Sakuden (1554–1642), one of the originators of Rakugo and himself a Pure Land monk, authored the earliest book of Rakugo stories by collecting humorous episodes from his own sermons.7</p>
<p>For a second source of Rakugo, we look to Edo comedy culture. Nobuhiro Shinji has studied private gatherings among the emerging middle class for sharing otoshi-banashi, or comedic stories. Utei Enba (1743–1822), a predecessor of Edo Rakugo, was a master architect who arranged such meetings after his retirement. Having already created a kind of fan club for the famous Kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjūrō V (1741–1806), he was able to attract writers and actors from among the intelligentsia. Enba later published books on those gatherings which are testimony to this original form of what were later to become public Rakugo performances.8</p>
<p>It is worth noting that on both counts, the origins of Rakugo are connected with laughter. But as more and more performers took to the stage and drew ever larger audiences, the genre expanded as well. It is said that around the end of the Edo era, there were over one hundred Rakugo halls, where melodramatic tales and ghost stories also came to find their place.9</p>
<p>the modernization of ghosts</p>
<p>San’yūtei Enchō (1839–1900) secured his position in the world of Rakugo by imitating the Kabuki plays but making his performances more accessible to the general population of Edo.10 In addition to being an extraordinary performer and a master in the San’yūtei family line, he was an accomplished author who produced a wide range of plays, including some of Japan’s best-known ghost stories. His first book, Kaidan botan dōrō (Ghostly Tales of a Peony Lantern), was published after the Meiji Restoration in 1886 and represents a pioneering step in the publication boom that Rakugo performances enjoyed during this period. The most famous part of Botan dōrō consists of a love story between a young man and a woman ghost. It is said to have been based on earlier works like Otogi bōko (Hand Puppets, 1666) by Asai Ryōi and the much older Jiandeng xinhua (New Tales while Trimming the Wick, 1378) by the Chinese writer Qu You. Enchō’s transformation of the story became one of the signature items in his repertoire and helped earn him the accolade of “the God of Rakugo” in later years.</p>
<p>Finally, we may mention his 1888 work Shinkei kasane ga fuchi [The True Landscape of the Kasane Abyss],11 which opens with an apology for telling ghost stories to a Japanese audience caught up in the movement rush for “Civilization and Enlightenment”:</p>
<p>What are called “ghost stories” have greatly declined in recent times; there is hardly anyone who does them at the variety halls. That is to say, since there are no such things as ghosts and they all have come to be called neurosis, ghost stories are unseemly things to the professors of civilization.... By saying that it’s a neurosis because there’s no such things as fox-possession and goblin abduction, they completely fob off any and all frightening things on neurosis.12</p>
<p>What is interesting is that he does not allow criticism of the “professors of civilization” and arguments to explain away superstitions as fictions grounded in neurosis to obliterate the world of ghosts altogether. Given the currency among his audience of European notions of what it meant to be civilized and cultured, it was not possible for Enchō to tell his tales in the traditional way. Instead, he made use of modern terms like “neurosis” to account for the cause of the mysterious, unearthly, and frightening world of ghosts in a language his listeners would have appreciated without at the same time denying their effects in actual experience. His logic ran something like this: At present, no one believes that ghosts actually exist, but neither can any of us deny the psychological phenomena associated with them. Accordingly, it was up to the storyteller to conjure up the shadowy and spine-chilling feelings elicited by the spirit world in such a way as to revive the awe-inspiring character of ghosts that had long been part of the Japanese tradition.</p>
<p>Ryūō, the Rakugo performer whose work we are presenting here, was a contemporary of Enchō’s and a storyteller on par with that celebrated “God of Rakugo.” He, too, made use of the fashionable medical terminology of the day and, to some extent, shared Enchō’s reasons for doing so. Still, unlike the Botan dōrō, where a Buddhist monk is introduced to perform a successful exorcism of the woman ghost, Ryūō offers no such respite for the victims of Iwa’s curse. She is not allowed to fall into Hell and out of reach of the world of the living. On the contrary, in a rage of jealousy she announces her plan to take vengeance, and only then turns into a haunting demon. The Shinto and Buddhist priests who are called in to drive her out are exposed as avaricious charlatans, whose incantations and rituals are exposed as so much religious chicanery.</p>
<p>the buddhist framework of rakugo</p>
<p>When it comes to the meaning of horror stories for the people of Edo, one of the key elements is the importance of religious fear and the perspective it put on the things of life. Sekiyama explains:</p>
<p>There is a reason that ghosts and horror stories were popular in the Edo period. Buddhism was a vital part of everyday life, but so was the guilt people carried around with them. It is hard for us to imagine in these times the pity for the restless dead and the fear of their retribution that was prevalent at the time. So numerous were the sermons expounding on the Buddhist scriptures, and so vivid the pictures of Hell meant to unnerve the common folk, that one may even consider these horror stories a kind of Buddhist entertainment and extension of what was being taught in the sermons. There is no denying the influence of the terror and awe these stories inspired. Indeed, we cannot escape the makings of a philosophy of everyday life behind the ghost tales.13</p>
<p>In stressing the impact of Buddhism on daily life in late nineteenth-century Japan, Sekiyama sets himself solidly against Konita’s view of the “irrelevance of the religious dimension” in the tales. While there is no gainsaying the cultural and generational gap between those who listened to the story live and those coming later who only read it in a book, the difference of rhetorical genre seems more significant. The fact that the novel was published underground shows its intention of exposing the truth behind a legend. The intention behind its performance in the theater was rather to give the audience what they expected: an entertaining scare for a nominal fee.</p>
<p>Sekiyama’s mention of a “guilty conscience” regarding the restless dead is something which de Benneville also took seriously as a longstanding element in Buddhist rituals and beliefs. In that sense, it is one more key to unlocking the enchanting power of Japanese ghost stories.</p>
<p>guilt and dread towards the dead</p>
<p>I find it significant that in his original preface to the English translation, de Benneville introduces his readers to the world of ghost stories by referencing records of oral performance like Rakugo and Kōdan14 that have survived through transcriptions in shorthand. In particular, he echoes Enchō’s apology in the following remark on the relationship between a sense of guilt and feeling of dread: </p>
<p>Curiously enough, it can be said that most Nipponese ghost stories are true. When a sword is found enshrined, itself the malevolent influence—as is the Muramasa blade of the Hamamatsu Suwa Jinja, the subject of the Komatsu Onryō of Matsubayashi Hakuchi15 —and with such tradition attached to it, it is difficult to deny a basis of fact attaching to the tradition. The ghost story becomes merely an elaboration of an event that powerfully impressed the men of the day and place. Moreover this naturalistic element can be detected in the stories themselves. Nipponese writers of to-day explain most of them by the word shinkei— “nerves”; the working of a guilty conscience moulding succeeding events, and interpreting the results to the subsequent disaster involved.16</p>
<p>Although the claim that the ghost stories are “true” sounds slightly naive, it is a fact that shrines in Japan each have their own origin story—typically associated with an actual historical event or sacred treasured object—and that these stories occasionally provided a basis for ghost stories. As the passage notes, the tales elaborated by Rakugo and Kōdan authors had a strong influence on the general worldview of the time. Insofar as these storytellers inhaled the air of an enlightenment civilization with its talk of like “nerves” and “neurosis,” superstitions tended to fade away and there was little oxygen left to feed popular belief in ghosts. </p>
<p>This is where the “guilty conscience” comes into the picture to provide a kind of psychological framework for explaining the emotional states associated with suffering the death of a loved one from indeterminate causes or other unforeseen tragedies. The quasi-scientific nature of such reasoning was meant to replace the magico-religious modes of thought of days gone by; in fact, it simply replaced one unknown by another: ignotum per ignotius. It was in that gap that the imaginary world of ghosts and curses and vengeance from beyond the grave flourished. In this way, the very discourse of modernity that meant to do away with that world was able to breathe new life into it. That ghosts continued to disquiet the modernized mind may only mean that as older superstitions fell away, they laid bare a genuine human need for the pangs of conscience to strike terror into our frail, rational selves.</p>
<p>Iwa’s memorialization in Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples is more than a touristic attraction. Her story belongs very much to our own age. My hope is that the readers of this book will be able to see through the enlightened, scientific background in which modern reason thrives to savor the traditional world of haunting ghosts and recover the questions it poses about the baffling mystery of what it means to be human.17</p>
<p>a note on the revision of the translation</p>
<p>The original translation of James de Benneville has gone through radical revision for the present edition. A word of justification seems in order for reissuing a book that has already been reprinted several times with only a new title to distinguish it from the 1917 edition.18 As evidenced from the extracts cited in the previous pages, de Benneville’s English style is rather peculiar, even by the literary standards of his age. The same impression, to varying degrees, holds for other works of his that I have had occasion to consult. In the case of the present volume, however, the more serious problem lies with oddities in the “translation.”</p>
<p>Simply put, the prose is often so unnatural and the underlying Japanese syntax, grammar, and turns of phrase so transparent on the surface of the text, that it is hard to imagine de Benneville to have been the author of the original draft. It seems more likely that he simply retouched the translation of a Japanese acquaintance in order to prepare it for publication in English. Even discounting mistakes in the transcription of Japanese words, irregularities in the use of definite and indefinite articles, and similar lapses typically generated by non-native writers of English, the quality of the writing as a whole does not reflect de Benneville’s reputation as a scholar and translator.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no complete Japanese text against which to compare the translation.19 De Benneville indicates that the translation is “retold from the Japanese originals” and “based on the Yotsuya zōdan,20” but he introduces characters (such as Suzuki Sanjūrō the moneylender), conversations, details, and flourishes of expression which are not to be found there and have proved impossible to track down. How much of it was his own invention and how much the learned glosses of someone familiar with the variety of Rakugo performances we shall probably never know. </p>
<p>The absence of an objective check has made the revision easier at some times, more difficult at others. In particular, there are a great many passages in which the flow of the story becomes choppy or the meaning of the English has been jeopardized by errors of usage or missing words. Where the Yotsuya zōtan did not prove helpful, the only remedy was to reconstruct the passages in such a way as to preserve the integrity of the story line and the quaint flavor of early twentieth-century English without compromising the general readability of the text. I would like to acknowledge the kind assistance of James Heisig, a colleague at the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture, in overseeing the editorial process.</p>
<p>Even for those of my generation, born around 1980, when programs on the occult flooded Japanese television and enjoyed wide popular appeal, the story of Iwa remained something of an icon in the horror genre. While it is true that the Yotsuya kaidan drew on the popular imagination of the Edo period to frame the story of Iwa, there is a classic authenticity to the figure of Lady Iwa and her curse that still speaks to us today. The fascination that drew viewers in Japan and across the world into the haunting imagery of Hideo Nakata’s 1998 movie Ring continues to this day in the enduring belief that “The enraged spirit of Sadako may still be on the roam.” In this sense, she is a true successor in the line of Iwa.</p>
<p>My aim in dusting off this timeworn and neglected text is to stimulate renewed interest in the wide variety of Japanese ghost stories and the art of Rakugo storytelling that has played such an important role in their creation and development. Like the innocent bystanders who watched the events of Samon-chō unfold, all of us share in the fears and uncertainties—as well as the intellectual curiosity—that shroud the world of the dead and give rise to stories like the Yotsuya kaidan.21</p>
<p>To all of those who have helped me see this book to completion and turn the spotlight once again on the legend of Lady Iwa, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>Saitō TakashiNagoya, Japan</p>
<p>1 Mino and Densuke</p>
<p>Yotsuya is a suburb in the far west of Edo. Its narrow, winding streets are hilly, especially to the south near the Aoyama district with its many cemeteries and palaces—whitened sepulchres them all, inside and out. Echizenbori stands at the other end of the great city, facing east toward the banks of the Sumida River. Across the wide river lie the populous and now poverty-stricken districts of Honjo and Fukagawa. Its location, along with other qualities, keeps Echizenbori in line. In fact, it is a very staid and stable district of the city. Its narrow streets are full of small shops providing for the daily needs of its inhabitants. The rows of shops are sandwiched in between large blocks of buildings, some of them warehouses and residences for the shopowners. These structures line the canals of Echizenbori, whose waterways are crowded with junks carrying freight by the tens and hundreds of tons: precious cargoes of rice to go into storage, hundreds of kegs of soy sauce, thousands of bales of Sakura charcoal, fresh fish, dried fish, and pickled radishes—the whole hodgepodge of stuff, in gross, that make up the necessities of life in a great city. Despite its obvious signs of poverty and very little display of wealth, Echizen-bori is not one of the poorer quarters of this capital city of Edo.</p>
<p>Crossing the Takabashi Bridge from Hatchōbori and heading down the narrow street on the opposite side, with a short turn to the right, a plunge down another narrow street, and another turn to the right, one comes to a high cement wall whose modern style makes it unlikely that it is a part of a shrine or temple. Its gateway is tight and formal, almost like an entrance to a garden or small burial ground. Inside, everything is different from the busy world without. The enclosure itself is small—perhaps a hundred and fifty feet square—and divided into sections by a maze of cheap iron lanterns set on ordinary wooden posts. On the right we see a small sanctuary or two dedicated to the god Inari; on the left, a small structure with a row of niches for prayer offerings, some of them crude, some of them more elaborate. The most striking of them shows a petite geisha portrayed against a gallant landscape of days gone by. In another, we see a paramour idolized in the eyes of the women of our times. Outside the structure are posted hundreds of pictures of once godforsaken women now elated at the power of the Tamiya Shrine for having restored to them the waylaid affections of a husband or lover. Next along the line is a kind of open shed, where the casual visitor is likely to encounter one or the other supplicant patiently trotting around in a circle and reciting their prayers until they have completed the “hundred rounds.”</p>
<p>Just opposite and close by is the main shrine. It consists of a massive repository set in the back and a statue of the Inari divinity facing frontwards. The floor on both sides of the shrine is often piled high with barrels of soy sauce and saké, bundles of charcoal, valuables of the kind wealthier shopkeepers might offer to the powerful lady, and long tresses of women either too poor to offer anything else or wise enough to know that there is no greater sacrifice a woman can make. How many there are! But, after all, is it not a woman they have come to venerate?</p>
<p>On entering the shrine, one passes a soft-spoken custodian peddling his charms and offering often badly needed advice (no doubt the most beneficial of his duties). Inside and to the left is the inner shrine containing the memorial tablet of Iwa. From the elaborate congestion of this one small corner of the surrounding sanctum, it is obvious not only that the shrine is popular and wealthy, but also that the lady to whom reverence is being paid is greatly feared and her awesome powers greatly sought after.</p>
<p>Echizenbori is not a particularly old quarter of the city. Long after Edo was established, the city expanded step by step down to the river, filling in the lagoons and swamps, channelling the water into canals that would serve as the principle means of transport. Yotsuya, in contrast, is older and its poverty more recent. In the days of Edo it was a favorite residential area for police constables, civil servants, and a whole horde of minor officials entrusted with the actual running of the complex machinery of the Tokugawa government. On a map dating from 1857, the shrine of the Iwa Inari is located in an area of Samon-chō known as Tera-machi, or “temple town,” painted red on the map to indicate the presence of temples and shrines. These holy places and their considerable lands made up a large part of Yotsuya. How then, you may ask, did the shrine come to be relocated in a remote area of Echizenbori, and in such incongruous surroundings? The explanation lies in the story we are about to tell.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Tenwa period (1681–1684), Tamiya Matazaemon had been a long-time resident in Yotsuya Samon-chō. He held the rank of constable in the Tokugawa administration. Constables were among the highest-ranking permanent staff of the bureaucracy and, as such, were responsible for the smooth working of the government. Matazaemon was a model under-official of his time: polished, civil yet insolent toward his peers, harsh toward his inferiors, unctuous and fawning toward his superiors. In fact, he paid more attention to those just above him than to those of higher, more distant rank. He served his higher lord by serving his immediate superior, to whom he was always careful to give all the credit. No small part of his function was to see to it that ceremonial form and precedent were maintained to the letter. Having access to accurate information was of great importance to his superior, as it might save him from a false step down the line. Matazaemon’s preparedness and demeanor made him deservedly valuable, and as a result he enjoyed a double salary of thirty sacks of rice, which was supplemented by the generous honoraria he received as a master of flower arrangement and the tea ceremony. His house was more than adequate for a person of his stature. It opened on to the wide Samon-chō road and was furnished with a garden set against the background of the long line of temples running eastward from the main thoroughfare through Tera-machi. The Tamiya garden stood almost directly opposite the entrance to Kenshō-ji temple, one of the few relics remaining from the time. It had space enough for fifteen or twenty fruit trees, mainly persimmon as Matazaemon was a practical sort. Each year the cherry trees would display their blossoms against the rich, dark green foliage of the persimmons. In one corner, highlighting the mystique of a small Inari shrine left behind by a former owner, stood five or six old and gnarled plum trees, propped up by wooden crutches but still able to diffuse their delicate perfume throughout the garden and into the house during the month of March.</p>
<p>Such was the home where Matazaemon lived and which he would later pass on to Iwa. There was room enough to lodge a large household, but the master of the Tamiya family was a tight-fisted man. He was rather like an unripe loquat: tough and bitter on the outside as if to guard the treasure at its core, a large and worthless pit; the sour taste of the pulp, a thin mask meant to disguise a narrow-minded adherence to official routine; the smooth and easily peeled skin, the mark of a short, acidic temper and a pretense to social status. He was constantly at odds with most of his neighbors and all of his kin. As a dutiful officer secure in his lord’s favor, the dislike of other residents in the ward were of little concern, and he was always prepared to draw his sword against the head of his ward association, Itō Kaiho. As for Matazaemon’s relatives, they were eager to get closer to him—and he knew it.</p>
<p>His household consisted of his wife Naka, a daughter Mino, and a manservant named Densuke. Matazaemon would allow no one to tend the garden but himself. The two women saw to the upkeep of the house, a duty that would customarily fall to them as women, and more besides. Densuke performed the heavier tasks, accompanied his master on outings, and represented his master’s contribution to protecting the gate to the city walls on the great Kōshū Highway. The gatehouse where the guards from the ward kept watch stood between Yotsuya and the Naitō-Shinjuku district. It was considered an important entrance into Edo. When the time for service arrived, Densuke was decked out in full uniform and armed with a pike. He was a handsome young man of nineteen years and the women, especially Mino, saw to it that his appearance would be a credit to the house. She followed his progress up the wide Samon-chō street until he disappeared into the main thoroughfare. So did the neighbors, whose eyes and tongues were a far side sharper than those of Matazaemon and his wife. They had good reason to wonder, for in the eyes of her parents, Mino was the most beautiful creature ever created. Nonetheless, Matazaemon would occasionally venture a word of criticism.</p>
<p>“Naka, you need to speak to Mino. She uses too much powder on her face. It would be another thing if her skin were very dark to begin with.”</p>
<p>He addressed her in his most officious manner and tone of voice. His wife and daughter listened, but neither of them obeyed: the wife because she had a soft spot for her daughter, and the daughter because she was envious of Densuke’s light skin and wished to appear fairer in his eyes.</p>
<p>Mino was a victim of fate and fortune. She had been born ugly, with a broad, flat face like a full moon or a serving plate. She had a slight humpback and her arms were disproportionately long, lacking in substance what they gained in extension. She seemed to have no breasts at all; her chest caved inwards to match the outward curvature of her back and was as smooth as the inside of a bowl. Given the circumstances, this may not have been a disadvantage.</p>
<p>So much for fate. Fortune had been no kinder. In the “bloom” of adolescence, she had an attack of smallpox. Matazaemon was busy and had no experience in taking care of the sick. Naka was well intentioned but equally unprepared. Naturally, the servant girl was no help either. The itching nearly drove her crazy and there was no one to stop her from scratching away at the sores that covered her face and body. Naka kindly tried to help, but in the end Mino was left with hideous pockmarks. The disease also cost her an eye, leaving a gaping and unsightly hole of a wound like a kudzu dumpling, a white puffy mass of dough with a hole in the center for a dab of dark-brown bean paste. The neighbors used to say that Mino was “three parts human and seven parts obake.” The nastier among them reduced the proportion to one part human. Not without reason, the children always referred to her as “the demon.” They refused to play with her and were cruel toward her. Mino was anything but mild mannered and soon learned to put her unusually robust frame to use in retaliating. The bitter disposition she had inherited from her father and cultivated by force of circumstance also worked to her advantage. When the odds were in her favor, Mino would not be the only one reduced to tears. All in all, however, she suffered a great deal and came to realize over the years that the safest place for her to play was in the Tamiya garden.</p>
<p>As Mino grew into womanhood, her affections needed an outlet. They came to rest not on her practical but very ordinary mother, nor on her self-absorbed and crabby father, but on Densuke the attendant. She performed all manner of little services for him, even those that would rightly fall within his own duties. At first she contrived small assignments for him to carry out that were not within the scope of his usual responsibilities, and paid him handsomely for it. This began already from the time he first arrived at the household, but she grew bolder with time. Densuke would find his torn clothing mysteriously mended or replaced. She would take care of his laundry, right down to the loincloths. For his part, Densuke dared not question her or resist her efforts on his behalf. Every mistake he made, no matter how trifling, she would blame on her own meddling. She grew more and more forward, seeking his assistance in her own duties until finally they became like maidservant and manservant in the same employment. When Matazaemon began to notice small increases in household expenses, she knew that her own extravagance was to blame, but it was at Densuke that he grumbled.</p>
<p>“What is taken from one end must be compensated for at the other. Oil is very expensive, Densuke. We don’t need light at night, so be sure to blow out the lamp before you go to bed.”</p>
<p>Densuke followed his master’s instruction beginning that very night, which was also the first night Mino ventured into his bed. Confused and frightened but overpowered by the woman’s passion, Densuke sinned against his master, with the master’s own daughter as an accomplice.</p>
<p>From that time on, Mino was willing to do whatever Densuke wanted. Once Matazaemon had left for his duties, Mino—and under her orders, Naka—took over all of Densuke’s household chores. The only thing her mother asked in return was that he submit to Mino’s needs. This was no mean burden. From time to time he thought about escaping back to his home village of Tōgane in Kazusa or to his uncle Kyūbei’s in the Kanda district of Edo. Mino seemed to divine his very thoughts. She would shower him with favors or openly express her desire to follow wherever life would take him. To Kanda? Kyūbei was a familiar freeloader at the Tamiya home and Matazaemon included him in his annual budget of expenses. There was no way to avoid Kyūbei. Matazaemon had farms in the area and the village headman was a servant of his. Besides, Densuke would be a runaway and Matazaemon could surely count on Kyūbei to cooperate. The months passed and things were left to drift.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a bit of gossip from the quarter that had reached his otherwise inattentive ears, but as Matazaemon was about to set out for work one day, his tiny eyes squinted sharply at Mino’s appearance.</p>
<p>“Naka, something seems to have changed with our daughter. Surely the neighbors’ chatter about Densuke is not true? They say Mino is carrying his child. If that were so, both of them would have to be killed. Better warn Mino ahead of time that an attendant is not about to become an adopted son of the Tamiya family. He is an excellent lad and costs us little. He’s not reckless in his way, and to dismiss him without cause would be unjust and serve no purpose. Just have Mino heed our warnings and all will be well.”</p>
<p>And with that, the master of the house stalked off to the entrance, picked up his clogs from Mino, and marched off to attend to the duties of his post. The two women, kneeling prostrate to see him off, raised their heads to follow his steady gait.</p>
<p>Overcome with fear, Naka turned to her daughter and whispered.</p>
<p>“Did you hear what your honorable father said? If not, you should know that neighborhood gossip about your relations with Densuke has come to his attention. A man’s eye may not be alert to such things, but even he has noticed that you seldom put on a sash, and that when you do, it is quickly taken off again. Even I find this hard to justify. Surely the reports are not true….”</p>
<p>Mino may have been ugly but she was hardly dense. Her mother must have known, and yet somehow it seemed she did not.</p>
<p>“My honorable father seems to have forgotten the difference of age and status between Densuke and me. He is no more than a boy and I am more than twenty-three years old. Surely I deserve a better husband than an attendant. The last thing I want is give my father cause for regret or bring him pain. But how could a woman become pregnant without a man?”</p>
<p>Mino bowed respectfully as she spoke and then raised her head. The two women looked each other in the face. Naka paused a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to hear this, but Matazaemon is short-tempered, and even if he only has suspicions, it is best to steer clear of him. Meanwhile, we must attend to the affairs of the household, which should keep us busy until late. The merchants will be coming around to collect their monthly payments. You will find ten silver ryō in the chest; here are the keys. It would be good to take an inventory of what we have on hand. Winter is coming and we have to make provision to keep warm. You had best remain vigilant.”</p>
<p>With these words and a somber look at her wayward daughter, Naka donned her street garb, threw a cloak over her shoulders, stepped into her clogs, and clitter-clattered down the street and out of sight.</p>
<p>Her departure nearly coincided with the reappearance of Densuke. After accompanying his master to the palace stables, the two returned briefly to the house. In this way, Matazaemon, tried to strike a balance between his public responsibilities and the management of his household. For his part, Densuke was far from comfortable. In his own way, he tried to remain faithful to Mino, but he was also very much afraid of her. Even in their most private intercourse, to him she was always the daughter of the family and he had no other recourse than to remain in the Tamiya house. Once she was sure of their alliance, Mino had stopped paying him, thus depriving him of the means to indulge in the occasional indiscretion in the licensed quarters of Shinjuku. Their trysts took place in the dark of night. Naka, who was usually alone in the daytime, looked to her daughter for company, although she had no mind to be too complacent about the intrigue going on around her.</p>
<p>As soon as Mino heard the sound of Densuke’s steps, she called out to him. There was a seriousness in her tone, a decisive note of alarm that frightened him and gave him the chills. Obediently, he sought her out. He was quick to note the absence of Naka, but all the same knelt prostrate to greet her. His head bowed, he could not see her face but he could detect impatience in her voice.</p>
<p>“This is neither the time nor the place for greetings. I no longer speak just in my name as the daughter of the household but in the name of my mother well. My father knows everything about you and me. If he finds us on his return, he is sure to kill us. That is his right and it is our duty to submit to his punishment. But to consign an infant in the womb from one darkness to another is too dreadful to imagine. It may not be the filial thing to do, but we must run away. It’s time for you to make up your mind.”</p>
<p>Densuke looked up and saw her hunched over and contemplating their impending flight. Her mouth was spread out at the corners, one eyelid folded heavily over its empty socket drooping more noticeably than usual, her bald brow with thinning, disheveled wisps and tufts of hair at its sides—in all, something of a hideous mask. He could not bear the sight. He spoke up timidly.</p>
<p>“That’s awful! How did it happen? Dear woman, you must have bungled it and said something rash. Can’t a woman take her pleasure with whom she pleases without such dire consequences? What a pity—such luxury, such pleasant surroundings, and all to be left behind! I will make off to my home town in Kazusa, but where will you go? What will you do?”</p>
<p>Was the question asked in innocence or in cunning and guile? As well as Mino thought she knew Densuke, she could not say. He felt a hand on his shoulder and jumped back in fright, not knowing whether it was a fiend or Mino transformed into a fiend who stood there before him, her mouth half open with its large, white teeth lined up in a row, her single eye casting an evil gleam while the fold of skin over the empty socket quivered and shook. She was a sight to behold.</p>
<p>“Pleasure without consequences, indeed! What a fool you are. You are caught between two worlds and now you want to abandon me. Very well, do so. But I will not perish by my father’s sword. There is a well nearby, but I warn you, within three days I shall return and hunt you down. You will die a miserable death, torn to pieces. Better to die with me here and now. One final farewell for you….”</p>
<p>Two powerful arms seized him by the neck. Densuke let out an agonized cry as her sharp teeth bit into his ear. She let go of him and darted for the passageway. Frightened though he was, Densuke was too quick for her. He grabbed hold of her robe.</p>
<p>“No! You must not act so desperately. I was at a loss what to do and have spoken clumsily…. Yes, run away…. There is always my uncle Kawai in Kanda. I will go to him and learn what Master Tamiya plans to do.”</p>
<p>The look of tragedy faded from Mino’s face. At once she became the practical woman of the house, grateful for her mother’s foresight.</p>
<p>“We cannot afford to escape without provisions. Here are ten silver ryō. We will prepare a bundle of clothing and other effects for you to carry. As for your uncle, if I am to present myself to him for the first time as your wife, I shall need a present. What should it be?”</p>
<p>She chattered away as she busied herself with piling clothes, blankets, and toiletries in a large carrying cloth. Then she tidied herself up with the greatest of care, sober but fashionable as befits a newlywed. Slowly Densuke regained his composure in the whirlwind of unexpected confusion into which he had been thrown.</p>
<p>“My uncle’s teeth are bad. Soft pickled radishes are just the thing. For a long time he has eaten little else. Four or five should be enough.”</p>
<p>He went to the kitchen to prepare the precious pickles and then gathered up his own possessions. There he stood, with the huge cloth bundle on his shoulder, a straw raincoat, sun hat, clogs for wet and dry weather tossed over the top, and a parcel of pickles dangling from his side.</p>
<p>“It’s like running away from a fire.”</p>
<p>Mino watched Densuke closely as he departed. He was too subdued, too scared to give her any cause for concern. Later she left the house to join him at the Hanzōbashi Bridge at a safe distance from Yotsuya. It was December, 1682.</p>
<p>2 Kawai of Kanda Ward</p>
<p>Densuke’s uncle Kawai Kyūbei was a rice merchant working out of a shop in Matsuda-chō in Kanda, a considerable distance away. As ladies are wont to do, Mino kept Densuke waiting for a long time at the Hanzōbashi Bridge. This uncomely, neglected, hardened girl had a strong romantic side. She waited at the corner of Tera-machi for the sound of Naka’s clogs and watched as the silhouette of mother’s figure emerged from the dusk and disappeared into the house. Weeping, she made her way down the street toward the Samegabashi Bridge. It was already late, around nine o’clock, when the pair reached Kanda. The day’s business was long over in this commercial section of Edo and the houses were tightly shut. On reaching the entrance of Kyūbei’s house, Densuke turned to Mino. </p>
<p>“Kindly wait here a moment. I have to inform my uncle of our arrival. And please keep an eye on our bundle and don’t let the dogs nibble at the pickles.”</p>
<p>He pounded on the door and a voice reported from with.</p>
<p>“Auntie, auntie! Someone is here. Please answer the door.”</p>
<p>The softer, more halting tones of an old woman answered.</p>
<p>“It’s not my turn. You see to it, and find out who it is before letting them in. We have so little and can’t afford to lose any more. My goodness! How sad to see the way you neglect Master Tamiya of Yotsuya.”</p>
<p>The scolding droned on as the old man grumbled and lit a candle.</p>
<p>“All right, all right. I’ll go to Tamiya’s tomorrow. But, well, it’s no laughing matter getting to that house. For one thing, it’s so far away, and ….”</p>
<p>He opened the door and his jaw dropped.</p>
<p>“Densuke, you rascal! What are you doing here, and at this hour? Ah, but I’m in luck. I see you have a bundle with you, a really big one.”</p>
<p>Kyūbei’s eyes fell on the pickled radishes and his face broadened into a smile.</p>
<p>“Well, if you’ve been dismissed, I’m sure there was a good reason. No doubt the pickled radishes are for me. Thank you. But is all this stuff yours? You didn’t steal it, did you? There must be a woman behind it all. Never mind. We might be able to arrange for you to marry into the family that runs the Bean Shop along a side street in the ward. They have been hoping for a boy but got another girl, and what with the wife now beyond the age of bearing any more children, they would welcome the chance to adopt a husband for her. The Mameya lass is just the thing. In a few months she will be fit to marry. She….”</p>
<p>Densuke interrupted the stream of words.</p>
<p>“You’re right, uncle. There is a woman behind my showing up.”</p>
<p>The old man grimaced.</p>
<p>“Well, in that case, all I can say is good riddance. I have heard the talk—and of all things, with that daughter of theirs! It would be downright awful. How is the little devil? What a sight she is! Balding and one-eyed, with a face like a dish and no nose to speak of. I came upon her suddenly one night in Yotsuya and, goodness me, I had cold feet and the chills for the next seven days. That’s what keeps me from going to Yotsuya, even though a little help from them would go a long way. My last sale of rice did not go well, and then there’s the outstanding account I have to settle with Tamiya. Mino may be ill-tempered and hard on the eyes, but she is right. Even for an ogre like her, a good match will present itself in time. She’ll become the wife of some respected vassal and her husband will be able to get himself a geisha and a wench with the dowry. That is what Tamiya is hoping for. That’s nothing for you to get mixed up in. Remember, she’s the daughter of a vassal of the shogunate. Sure, there are rumors about you in Yotsuya, but of course it’s all talk. Don’t let anything come of it.”</p>
<p>Densuke broke in again.</p>
<p>“Nothing’s going to happen.”</p>
<p>His expression betrayed his thought, and Kyūbei looked at him aghast.</p>
<p>“What! With that fiend? You committed a carnal sin with her? You filthy scoundrel, you! What a rash, inconsiderate boy you are! Auntie, auntie!… What did she pay you for doing that?… What a low and foolish rascal of a nephew you are to get caught in fornication with the fiend….. What an idiot! How did you manage to avoid being killed? You ran away. And then I suppose she got pregnant. Tamiya is sure to hunt you down after he does away with her. Or maybe he will just hold on to Mino until he catches up with you. You have sinned together and you will die together. Oh, yes, and then to cross the Sanzu no Kawa River and climb the slopes of Shide no Yama to the other world in the company of the fiend—that’s just terrific. Terrific! And what’s to become of her? Why fall into such a trap with such an ugly old woman? Her riches are not for you. If they catch you here, our tatami will be ruined.”</p>
<p>Densuke countered to the old man’s ear.</p>
<p>“She threatened to kill herself if I refused to go along with her and then haunt me as a ghost. You have seen Tamiya’s daughter, uncle. How would you like to be haunted by her, to fall into her clutches and be tortured to death?… But then, here she is at your door.”</p>
<p>The old man sputtered and gasped before falling to his knees and groveling to greet her.</p>
<p>“Oh, you fool!… She is here in person… How could you trifle with the devil!… How could you stoop so low as to seduce the honorable daughter of Tamiya!… Line up ten hags in a row and pick out the worst… Are we now supposed to have her around?…. She’s a veritable ghost already. Getting a beautiful woman pregnant is bad enough. But what such a demon… Come in, then. Please enter….”</p>
<p>Mino slowly stepped forward. There was little chance that she had not heard Kyūbei’s mindless ravings. Her humble mein did little to veil the offence to her dignity.</p>
<p>“It’s all true. We come as husband and wife. I ask you kindly to give shelter for the time being and to intercede on our behalf with my father. That is what I ask.”</p>
<p>She bowed low on the tatami as she spoke. Kyūbei got the hint. She had heard Densuke and most assuredly had caught his own much louder expletives and ill-timed wit. Her aunt was enraged and took matters into her own hands.</p>
<p>“We will make them feel at home in our poor home for as long as they want. Clearly the visitors have not come empty handed. Goodness me! They look as if they had escaped from a fire. Densuke’s a strong lad to have shouldered such a load. But then again, he always has been something of a mule. As for Matazaemon, you shall look into things tomorrow and find out what’s to be dome. In the meantime, we will treat them as if they were the guests of Samon-chō itself.”</p>
<p>The kindly old woman brushed Kyūbei and his clumsy apologies aside and busied herself with Mino. The two women understood each other. The motley contents of the cloth bundle were quickly stowed away and a modest supper was prepared for the hungry fugitives. Kyūbei sat by, dazzled by the wealth of goods laid out, his nostrils trembling anxiously at the pungent fragrance of the pickled radishes as he pondered the folly of his initial reaction.</p>
<p>Kyūbei arose early the next morning. Matazaemon was not one to dawdle and it was best to catch him in a good mood after breakfast. Perhaps he was devastated by the loss of his daughter the night before. It was far from a pleasant mission for Kyūbei. His pace slowed as he shuffled toward the garden gate in Tera-machi. He made his way to the kitchen side, where he found Naka going about her duties and no doubt awaiting his arrival. She was half laughing and half crying at the sight of him.</p>
<p>“Aha! It’s Kyūbei. I suppose you’re here on behalf of Mino and Densuke. It was kind of you to take them under your wing. The master is really quite angry. She is his only daughter and he was counting on her to bring a son-in-law into the family. You can understand why he’s upset. Please come in and speak with him. Show your displeasure with the runaways. Agreeing with him may help cool his temper. You will do this for us, won’t you?”</p>
<p>Kyūbei winked. As if he were about to have the anger redirected at himself! Agreeing with Tamiya might well have the opposite effect. That was the kind of hidebound official he was.</p>
<p>Matazaemon was taking the last sips of tea from his rice bowl when the papered doors slid apart and Kyūbei poked his head in. At first the master paid him no attention. Then he seemed to be in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Aha! It’s Kyūbei, is it? You’re here early today, but hardly to collect anything. The rice bills are not due for some weeks.”</p>
<p>His tone was grim, but the usual benign indifference with which he treated the villager was conspicuously absent. Kyūbei felt a chill. He was not about to become the victim for Densuke’s folly.</p>
<p>“I am here to appeal to your kindness.”</p>
<p>Matazaemon turned sharply in his direction. Frightened, the villager continued.</p>
<p>“Densuke has acted very badly. That base, lascivious scoundrel had the audacity to seduce your beloved daughter. I am here to inform you that the two of them have taken refuge at my house. Their lives are in your hands, Master Tamiya, but I beg you earnestly to delay taking any action. Mino is with child and it would be a terrible fate if the unborn infant were sent from one darkness into another. I pray you have it in your heart to show her mercy and kindness. As wicked and disrespectful as their actions have been, the ancient texts tell us that ‘justice demands that any offense be balanced with mercy.”</p>
<p>Matazaemon’s eyes lit up. He had heard that Kyūbei was on the verge of shaving his head and becoming a monk, and he could see that the teachings of his mentor had taken effect. He waited a moment before replying.</p>
<p>“You have a fine memory. Don’t let it fail you now. When a deed like this has been committed, the punishment is death, to be carried out at my hand. When I came to know the facts, I intended to kill them both. The flight of Mino and Densuke has made things more complicated. It is no longer necessary to exact the maximum punishment. Mino shall rather be disowned in this life and for seven births after it. Neither she nor Densuke is to show their face to me again. If the talk about town is to be believed, Densuke has traded his loyal service for a beautiful bride. Let him live with his choice without regret.”</p>
<p>His mood turned cheerful and mocking.</p>
<p>“You have been the one to show mercy. Now that I know you have taken in the two runaways, I say: treat them well, treat them well. They owe you a debt of gratitude. No doubt you will be busy with your new guests and we will see less of you in Yotsuya…. But duty calls and I must take my leave. You don’t need to hurry, though. Stay and have some tea…. Naka, Naka! Tea for Kyūbei, and bring me my cloak… Sayonara… Oh, and yes, the rice bills I am holding for you are due in the weeks ahead. But you are always one to meet your obligations. I have no worries on that account.”</p>
<p>With that parting shot ringing in his ears, Kyūbei remained kneeling prostrate as he listened to the sound of Matazaemon’s clogs on the flagstones outside and a reminder to Naka about the tea. At the sound of approaching footsteps, he raised his head to confront the lady of the house.</p>
<p>Naka spoke with tears in her eyes, a welcome salve to the worried and wounded feelings of Kyūbei.</p>
<p>“Don’t be frightened. After all, Matazaemon is a samurai; it is beneath him to harass you or any other merchant. But am I not ever to see my own daughter again? To stoke his anger further would spell disaster on her and her unborn child. What is to become of me? For now, give Mino this money and the valuables she left behind. In her rush to escape, she even forgot her mirror.”</p>
<p>Naka took out an elaborate piece of polished silver, a luxury for a woman of those times. It had been part of Naka’s own wedding outfit and now it was to be handed down to Mino. After that innocent lie, she went on.</p>
<p>“When the child is born, you must permit her grandmother to see her, at least from a distance. Perhaps it will resemble a Tamiya, like its mother, and may even soften her father’s heart.”</p>
<p>She sobbed bitterly, as did Kyūbei, but for different reasons. </p>
<p>“Like its mother?” he thought to himself. “The very buddhas of Daien-ji would weep at the sight of such a monster.”</p>
<p>Kyūbei kept his words to himself and bowed deeply in gratitude. Fully intending to keep his promise, he humbly accepted the mirror, the goods, and the money. With a sigh of remorse, he took his leave of Yotsuya—and a long leave it would be, he feared—to set out for Kanda. Once there, he reported on what had transpired, to which the village elders responded sternly, “A parent’s will is not to be disobeyed. It is your duty to carry it out.”</p>
<p>For his part, Kyūbei was thinking more of Naka than of the master of Tamiya. Mino may yet prove to be the goose that lays the golden egg. But a goose of such plumage! Kyūbei’s face twisted wryly in the darkness of the hallway.</p>
<p>3 Takahashi Daihachirō</p>
<p>Some means of support had to be found. To leave employ­ment in the household of a shogunate vassal under such circumstances made finding a similar post out of the question. These officials kept their own black list covering all levels of service. Only the passage of time and the need for increased staff in some great household might restore the young man to the only occupation he had ever known. Trusting in the chance that Densuke’s fortunes would make a turn for the better, Kyūbei took him on as an agent working on commission. Densuke was no slacker. It was largely through his hard work that Kyūbei managed to repay Tamiya the security due on his loans. </p>
<p>The married couple had taken up residence in Gorōbei-chō of Kyōbashi Ward. To all appearances, with all his comings and goings, often with no definite task in hand, Densuke seemed to be whiling away the time. Free at last from the constraints of her class, Mino was able to attend the theater and take in comedy shows in the capital. She was delighted to play the role of a merchant’s wife, confident that she would not meet up with her father, of whom she was deathly afraid. Bound to the ways of his class, Matazaemon might after all still feel compelled to cut her down on sight.</p>
<p>One day as Densuke was leaning idly over the parapet at Nihonbashi, he chanced to notice a group of fishermen quarrelling violently in the fish market on the banks just below the bridge. He was engrossed in the scene when suddenly he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned and saw a man dressed rather like a samurai’s attendant but looking more like a menial servant in a nobleman’s manor. From the scars of burns on his hands and arms, and the rice flour and bran sprinkled on his clothing, Densuke took him for a cook. With a stern look on his face, the man began to scold.</p>
<p>“You lazy oaf! I never fail to find you hanging around idly or on your way to Asakusa with your good wife. Are you just another good-for-nothing?”</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there was a knife stuck in the man’s waistband, the kind cooks use to carve fish or meat, Densuke was a gentle sort and responded softly to the rebuke.</p>
<p>“My idleness may not be what it seems. Buying and selling on commission is an unpredictable occupation. You’re right, though. I have no fixed job. How I miss the old days in service to a samurai!”</p>
<p>“Can you cook rice?” the man interrupted abruptly.</p>
<p>“I am rather familiar with the regulations of the Sanryaku. Is that enough?”</p>
<p>The man looked at him dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“The Sanryaku—what’s that?”</p>
<p>“In its full title, The Tree Strategies of the Duke of Yellow Rock. It’s a book of instructions on the duties of a samurai gentleman and outlines the three stages to cooking rice. The monk who taught me at a school in Kazusa Tōgane, a former samurai himself, was far more interested in the Sanryaku than in the sutras. His lessons had more to do with the way of chivalry than the way of the Buddha…. But to your point, I prepared rice for three years at the Tamiya household in Yotsuya. The process begins with the babbling bubble of water at full boil. Next comes the drip-drop of the water as it passes through the grains of rice. Finally, after the pot has been left to steam over a low fire, it lets out a shrill whistle like an infant crying. This is the sign that the rice is ready and can be removed from the stove.”</p>
<p>The man regarded the accomplished cook with respect.</p>
<p>“You’re just the replacement I’ve been looking for, Densuke. I have to leave Geishū’s kitchen at once to attend to my sick mother in Aki Province. The salary is next to nothing, but the benefits are considerable and there will be more than enough food to feed a married couple like you and your wife. Won’t you please accept my offer?”</p>
<p>Densuke did not hesitate.</p>
<p>“I am happy to oblige, but how secure is the position? And then there’s the matter of Master Tamiya to take into consideration….”</p>
<p>The man laughed.</p>
<p>“There are lots of men named Densuke in Edo. Besides, the residence of Matsudaira Aki no Kami has no connections to the household of a constable in Yotsuya, so there is little likelihood of them running into one another like old acquaintances. Just be sure to refer to yourself as Densuke of Kyōbashi rather than Densuke of Yotsuya when you give the gatekeeper this pass. Substitute help is not out of the ordinary. It doesn’t matter if it’s Densuke who does the cooking or I, so long as the rice is prepared properly. My duties take me elsewhere, but I am deeply in your debt.”</p>
<p>He held out the pass and Densuke took it.</p>
<p>The two said their good-byes and parted company satisfied. Densuke headed over to the manor of Matsudaira Aki no Kami at Kasumigaseki. Everything went smoothly. As it turned out, Tarōbei was not so excellent a cook that he could not be easily replaced. Densuke played the ceremonious groveler, like one of those “rice-pounding” grasshoppers continually bobbing its head up and down. In no time he came to be well liked. Even outside the hours of his duties, he was always willing to run errands for anyone in need. When the request came from someone higher up in the household, he was paid for his efforts. In this way, he was able to bring Mino twenty to thirty mon in cash each month, in addition to the ample rations of rice and radishes allotted to the kitchen staff. Since a cook was not permitted to let fish spoil, the leftovers also fell Densuke’s way.</p>
<p>As the months passed and the time of Mino’s delivery approached, a crisis began brewing for Densuke. It was time for Geishū to see to his periodic duties as a feudal lord. With the arrival of the iris blossoms, he left Edo to attend to the governance of his domain in Aki. The town commissioner, a certain Takahashi Daihachirō, asked to be excused from the journey for reasons of health and remain in Edo. For his own convenience, he moved into an abandoned quarters set up for foot soldiers and located immediately above the stoves where Densuke did his cooking. Cut off entirely from the bustle of the household, except for the rare occasions when Densuke would attend to him, Daihachirō enjoyed complete peace and quiet. Densuke went on preparing his meals as if nothing had changed.</p>
<p>Daihachirō was off-putting and greeted Densuke sullenly when he showed up late one evening to prepare supper. It was May the thirtieth, 1683, and he suspected that Densuke had been helping with the preparations for Boy’s Day or taking part in the festivities.</p>
<p>“Densuke, you’re very late. I tried to cook for myself but I soon realized I’m not cut out for it. I even got a serious burn on my right hand. A cook is expected to be on time for meals, not for festivals.”</p>
<p>Densuke was all apologies.</p>
<p>“No, sir, it is not the festival that has detained me; my wife was expected to have her baby today and I lost track of my duties. Please forgive me.”</p>
<p>“The birth of a child is no reason for me to go hungry. Hurry up and make my supper. Be sure the rice is soft, and the fish, too. Drawing a bath would be too much to ask, but I hear there are good bath-houses in Owari-chō and Kubo-machi.”</p>
<p>Densuke took the hint and recommended one he thought suited to Daihachirō’s status.</p>
<p>“I’m off, then. See that the meal is ready on my return.”</p>
<p>And with that, Takahashi Daihachirō marched off, towel in hand and a toothbrush and bag of rice bran tucked in his robe.</p>
<p>Densuke heaved a sigh of relief as he watched him cross the courtyard. Daihachirō would often charge him with one or the other task, but he but was never particularly generous in paying him, even when the transaction was decidedly shady. Densuke was very much afraid of him but had learned to resign himself to his fate. He turned his attention to the stoves and pots and pans, and in no time the meal was well on its way. But when he lifted the cover to inspect the rice— splash! A large red spot dropped onto the white surface and spread out into a circle. Densuke was aghast. He quickly slapped the lit back on the pot and looked up to see where the strange seepage had come from. Then a second drop landed smack on his forehead. He rubbed a finger across his brow and held it to his nose</p>
<p>“Oh, no—it’s blood! That wild cat of Take’s must have caught a rat in the upstairs room and be chewing on it. I’m in for it if Daihachirō finds out.…”</p>
<p>Hurriedly he tried to push the stove to one side, but it was hopeless. The massive stone blocks of the kiln were too heavy for Densuke to move on his own. He looked around helplessly. The rice was almost done and ready to be set to simmer on a low flame. The fish had been carefully prepared but had yet to be cooked. Everything was supposed to be waiting when Daihachirō returned. Just then the dripping started again. The loose boards in the ceiling had made a channel for the blood to stream down. The kitchen was beginning to look like a slaughterhouse in an outcast settlement. Densuke began to shudder..</p>
<p>When the stakes are high, the timid are often inspired to bravery. Grasping a pole, Densuke started up the ladder leading to the loft and the quarters of the foot soldiers. Once at the top, his eyes took in the shabby lodgings: a low-hanging roof held up by rafters and beams, and under it six tattered tatami mats spread out for the men to sit on and sleep on—the bare basics. A large red stain on the floor in the middle of the tatami caught his attention.</p>
<p>“A cat would eat a rat, but it wouldn’t bother to wipe up the blood.”</p>
<p>His eyes fell on a straw hamper used to store raincoats. The bottom was all stained red. He drew closer and saw that it was still wet. Perhaps the cat was in there and still at it. Densuke raised the cover and looked inside. He recoiled in horror as a freshly severed head resting on the trunk and limbs of a dead body looked back at him. Letting go of the lid and grasping a pole to hold over his head in defense, Densuke backed up towards the ladder. His only thought was to get as far away from the manor as he could. As his foot came to rest on the top rung, he heard the voice of Daihachirō below.</p>
<p>“A pox on those filthy bath-houses and their filthier patrons…. What! No rice yet, Densuke? Eh? Where have you gone to?”</p>
<p>Densuke looked down on Dai­hachirō staring grimly in his direction. He pulled back as Daihachirō sprung up the ladder and into the loft. He gave a quick look around and, noticing the uncovered basket, grabbed Densuke by the collar and forced him to the floor. Daihachirō glared at him in desperation.</p>
<p>“You foolish busybody! Why didn’t you just stick to your pots and pans? You are about to die and I am about to be left without my half-witted cook.”</p>
<p>As he drew his sword to strike, Densuke threw his arms around Daihachirō’s knees, begging for his life.</p>
<p>“Forgive me, my lord! Forgive me! Don’t think I’m one to spread idle gossip. The blood was dripping down and about to spoil the meal. I thought the cat was biting on a rat and came up to chase it away. I was afraid you would be angry if I had to start the rice all over again. That was how I discovered the crime.…”</p>
<p>“Crime?” thundered Daihachirō. “Now your must certainly pay for your meddling and die. They will take the word of a samurai….”</p>
<p>Terrified, Densuke tried to take back what he had said. His life was at stake.</p>
<p>“I beg you, forgive me. I have committed no offence and know of no one who has. I’ve seen nothing. Life is something precious and to be cherished at all costs. I am far too insignificant to deserve your anger.”</p>
<p>Watching Densuke grovel, frightened half out of his mind, Dai­hachirō hesitated. Just then an idea struck him and he broke into a sinister smile.</p>
<p>“You saw the head?”</p>
<p>“‘I did,” Densuke admitted. “But, but… seeing a head doesn’t mean anything.”</p>
<p>Daihachirō dragged him over to the hamper. Holding him down, he took hold of the severed head by the hair and pulled it out.</p>
<p>“Look!”</p>
<p>Densuke let out a cry of surprise as he recognized the face of one of his former neighbors.</p>
<p>“It’s the head of the Iseya shop, Jūsuke, the moneylender from Hatchōbori. He was a hard man to be sure. Surely you….”</p>
<p>“I did,” replied Daihachirō, carelessly tossing the macabre remains back into the basket.</p>
<p>“I had borrowed five ryō from him six months ago, but the interest drove the sum up to twenty-five. Citing ill health as an excuse, I stayed back in Edo, hoping to persuade the usurer to soften his terms. But he only began to insult me maliciously and threatened to report me to my master. I drew my sword and struck him down on the spot…. </p>
<p>“Here’s where you can be of use to me and save your own life at the same time. It’s worrisome having the corpse around. I want you to take it away and dispose of it. If you don’t, there will be a second head added to the first. Getting rid of one or two makes no difference to me. You decide. Agreed? Oh, and yes, you will be paid for it.”</p>
<p>He took out a money belt and Densuke recognized it as Jūsuke’s. After killing him, Daihachirō had robbed him as well. He ran his greedy fingers through the golden ryō. Densuke estimated there must have been seventy in all. Daihachirō took out three of the coins.</p>
<p>“Here you are. Your life will be spared, and in exchange you will see to disposing of the body.”</p>
<p>Densuke stammered, “On, on the rubbish heap?”</p>
<p>Daihachirō glared at him.</p>
<p>“Idiot! Why don’t I just announce to everyone that it was you who murdered Jūsuke? Once you are outside the gate of the manor, which is as far as I will accompany you, you become the culprit. Stay here until nightfall. Then make off with the corpse and dump it into the retaining ditch by the Kuroda residence or near Saitō’s place. Now I’ll take my supper—unless you have any objections?”</p>
<p>He looked menacingly at Densuke, who could not take his eyes off the cold, glittering steel of Daihachirō’s sword. As for Daihachirō, he did not give the desecration of the body a second thought but only swelled with pride at how well he was seeing to his master’s best interests. He descended the steps to take a leisurely supper and keep an eye on his unwilling accomplice.</p>
<p>The days are long in June, and Densuke, coward that he was, just sat there in the company of Jūsuke’s dead body. The hours passed in sheer torture for the poor cook. Again and again he went to the ladder and called down.</p>
<p>“Is it time yet?… No, it’s still light out and the streets will be full of people with lanterns. Clearly Old Man Sun has forgotten it’s time to set in the West. I’m doomed. I am so unlucky.”</p>
<p>At last it was nine o’clock and Dai­hachirō reappeared.</p>
<p>“Ready the body! Wrap it up in this matting…. What a weakling! Are you scared of a dead man?”</p>
<p>Daihachirō took the corpse and cut through the tendons of the arms and legs. Then he placed the head on the stomach and crossed the limbs over the trunk and alongside the head to hold it in place as he rolled the body up in the matting. Finally, he wrapped the matting in some red raincoats, “just in case there is any staining,” and secured the whole bundle with a sturdy rope. He stood back to admire his handiwork. Densuke paused to wonder how many other loan sharks Daihachirō had disposed of in this fashion. His reverie was cut short. Everything was ready.</p>
<p>“And now, if you would lend me your back….”</p>
<p>Densuke groaned, “Master, if I may.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” replied Daihachirō.</p>
<p>“Please put a board between my body and Jūsuke’s. I don’t want the head to reach out and bite me with its teeth.”</p>
<p>Daihachirō snorted with a mixture of amusement, contempt, and annoyance.</p>
<p>“What a spineless coward you are! Off with it just as it is.”</p>
<p>Densuke countered firmly but respectfully, “I’m the one who has to do it. At least you can do me this one favor.”</p>
<p>Daihachirō could see that Densuke was about to collapse of fright. He picked up the backpiece of an old suit of armor lying nearby.</p>
<p>“This will do even better. It’s metal. In it goes… Now off with you!”</p>
<p>Daihachirō shadowed the ill-fated cook from behind, keeping his sword within reach. When they had arrived at the gate, he spoke in a clearly audible voice.</p>
<p>“Be careful, now. These futons you are carrying need to be cleaned and mended.”</p>
<p>“As you wish.”</p>
<p>The gatekeeper dropped the crosspiece and stood to one side as Densuke stepped out into the street. After a short distance, he turned around to look. Takahashi Daihachirō had disappeared. From here on in, he and Jūsuke were on their own.</p>
<p>4 The Birth of Iwa</p>
<p>Densuke made his way with the pack on his back down the broad street lined on both sides with white-walled manors. The main road through this samurai quarter was not crowded with ordinary townsfolk carrying their lanterns. Densuke had every hope of disposing of his burden quickly. He approached the retaining ditch surrounding the wall of Prince Kuroda’s residence. Just as he was about to set his bundle down, the samurai guarding the gate called out to him.</p>
<p>“Hold it right there, you scoundrel! Wait up!”</p>
<p>Densuke did not wait. Terrified, he shifted the load on his shoulders and took off almost at a run. He felt something move on his back and, the poor fellow, his forehead broke out in a cold sweat. At any moment, Jūsuke’s teeth might sink into his back.</p>
<p>“Jūsuke, my good neighbor, I’m only the unfortunate courier here. It is Daihachirō who killed you. Go after him and hunt him down. I am begging you, Jūsuke!”</p>
<p>He felt empowered by his fear and became bolder. The Tiger’s Gate at the castle might be a better place for disposal. The retaining ditch there was deep and out of the light. Then again, it was the night of the festival and crowds of people would be swarming by with their lanterns. His thoughts shifted to the swamp in Kubo-machi. It would be open ground at this time. Relieved at his solution, he let the bundle slip from his weary shoulders. Had Jūsuke been alive, Densuke would have laughed at the idea of carrying around his portly frame. But here he was, with the crooked moneylender weighing him down more than he had ever weighed down any of his unfortunate clients.</p>
<p>“Let’s have a look at him, face to face.”</p>
<p>His hand was on the knot when he heard the voice of a woman speaking in his ear. Without waiting to hear what she had to say, he sped away into the darkness and toward the city in the distance. He wandered about aimlessly until he found himself at Shiodome. He crossed over the Shinbashi Bridge and into crowded and brightly lit Owari-chō. It was only nine o-clock and the lamps in the houses were still blazing. He hesitated, thinking it might be better to try his luck in the rural district of Shiba, or perhaps near the seashore, which was not too far off either.</p>
<p>A man approached and greeted him.</p>
<p>“Aha! I finally found you, Densuke. Your dear wife is really upset, so I set out thinking I might find you at the festival. Please, hurry home at once to Gorōbei-chō.”</p>
<p>Densuke repositioned his bundle away from the man, sniffing anxiously to see if there was any trace of the smell in the air. He offered a hasty excuse and turned with his heavy pack to follow behind slowly. Densuke was touched by his neighbor’s kind offer to share the load. He refused but could not shake off his companion. At last, in quiet desperation, he managed to make his own way back to the tenement. “I’m home,” he called from the doorway. He stepped into the ramshackle room and set his bundle down in the far corner. Mino looked on curiously as he walked over to the household altar and lit the candles.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” she asked, pointing to the bundle.</p>
<p>“It’s Daihachirō’s laundry.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’m too weak to do the washing on my own. How thoughtless of me!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it,” replied Densuke offhandedly. Mino did not like the tone of his voice. She eyed him sharply, but there were more pressing matters to attend do.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you’re so tired, but we need money for the midwife and other expenses. In a matter of hours I will be laid up in bed—perhaps for as long as three weeks. There is cooking and washing to be done. Please go to Kyūbei and ask him to lend you a ryō. He might at least give you half that.”</p>
<p>“He won’t give us anything,” snapped Densuke. “He’s fed up with lending money of late, but since my uncle is our only recourse in time of dire need, we should take care not to offend him. Anyway, there is no need for a loan now. Here’s three ryō.”</p>
<p>He pulled out the shining oblong coins. Mino’s eyes flashed with revulsion.</p>
<p>“So now you’ve become a thief? How did you get hold of this money? What happened? Why are you so late getting home?”</p>
<p>Densuke chose his words calmly, confident that he had the upper hand over Mino, given her present physical condition.</p>
<p>“No need to worry. What do you think, I’m some common thief or murderer like Hirai Gonpachi? Who knows, perhaps there’s a corpse in there and not dirty clothes after all. Would you like to see a freshly severed head? How about an arm or a leg?”</p>
<p>He laughed cynically as she turned her head toward the bundle and then back to Densuke again.</p>
<p>“I was given this money by Takahashi in return for services rendered in an important matter. Don’t be frightened. It was an honest arrangement.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you are not one to part so easily with a sum of three ryō,” mumbled Mino. “You always owe money to somebody. Jūsuke’s wife is always complaining to her husband about your delinquency. Still…”</p>
<p>Her confidence restored, Mino asked Densuke to put the money in the dresser drawer and ready some food for themselves and for the neighbors who had gathered to assist in the impending birth.</p>
<p>Densuke did as he was told, his eyes shifting from Mino to the stove and from the stove to the morbid bundle in the corner. Finally he picked up the bundle and carried it to the outer room, muttering something about the stench of the dirty laundry. He returned to his cooking. Soon Mino was sound asleep, having barely touched her food. Densuke looked down at her.</p>
<p>“Ugly, rich, a veritable obake in appearance. And yet she takes as her husband someone the likes of me, a spineless excuse for a man. Is that good fortune or bad? How I welcome her advice.”</p>
<p>Densuke went to bed in the outer room, only to spend the night in hideous nightmares featuring the late Jūsuke, whose lifeless corpse had already tainted the air with that indescribable reek that even the freshest cadaver gives off. Wild visions floated through his brain…. The neighbors are all assembled and the food laid out. And then in walks Jūsuke’s wife demanding to see her husband. In the bat of an eye, Densuke steals out the entrance and disappears into the darkness. The river? Yes—that’s it. The Hatchōbori canal runs right near Jūsuke’s home and would float his remains right to the front door. Densuke sees himself standing at the river’s edge, not a soul in sight. Splash! In goes the foul bundle. But suddenly it’s back again, only this time it’s Jūsuke in person.</p>
<p>“Jūsuke, Jūsuke! I’m so sorry! I wasn’t the one who killed you. Take your revenge against Daihachirō. He’s the murderer.”</p>
<p>Densuke was too terrified to worry about being heard. He shouted out at the top of his lungs. Jūsuke laid a heavy hand on him and Densuke let out a long groan—and awoke.</p>
<p>Mino bent over him distraught and white as a ghost. She could see that he was awake and pulled back her hand.</p>
<p>“What is the matter with you? All night long you’ve been screaming and babbling in your sleep. Just now you were crying out ‘Jūsuke, Jūsuke! Daihachirō!’ It turns out you were right to call for Jūsuke. My pains have begun and it won’t be long now. Go to Jūsuke’s and ask his wife Yoshi for help.”</p>
<p>Densuke sprang up and an idea flashed into his mind. He could go to Hatchōbori and make a full confession. But what was more important now, to have Yoshi as a confessor or as a midwife? He set off confused over what to do next. </p>
<p>On his way out the door, he issued a parting warning to Mino. “Whatever you do, keep your hands away from my bundle.”</p>
<p>Densuke could hardly have extended her a more direct invitation to do just that. At first Mino just eyed the strange object in the corner, but eventually she crawled over on her knees to have a closer look.</p>
<p>“Wrapped up in rain coats and bound with rope! What an odd way to carry laundry. And that strange smell! It’s like radishes being pickled in vinegar.”</p>
<p>She shook it. Something inside rattled. Her curiosity got the better of her and her original suspicions that Densuke had been up to no good returned. She poked a small hole in the straw wrapping and hit upon some kind of cloth. It must be a kimono, she thought. Then a kind of white object shining through the cloth caught her eye. She grabbed a kitchen knife from the brazier nearby and cut through the outer rope that held the parcel together. “What the…. !” A head, an arm, and a pair of twisted legs rolled out on the floor before her. She let out a shriek and fell back flat onto her back, terror-stricken. She lay there stretched out and petrified, exhaling one short, shrill cry after the other. In no time a flood of neighboring wives had rushed onto the scene.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? A young wife like you doesn’t scream without a good reason. Good heavens! You’ve given birth to a baby and…. what’s this? A head. No, a head and body and limbs. What a monstrous childbirth!”</p>
<p>Mino lay groaning from the pangs of delivery. The other wives stood around confused and the children flew off to call the menfolk. Soon the whole district was in an uproar. In the midst of it all, Densuke arrived with Jūsuke’s wife, to whom he had not yet summoned the courage to confess. He was still trying to make up his mind what to do when one of the neighbors called out to him.</p>
<p>“Densuke! Something eerie has happened to Mino. She has given birth to a head and a baby at the same time. Come with me, Densuke, and hurry!”</p>
<p>Densuke did hurry, but only to bolt down the first side street in a panic. Bewildered and not knowing what to make of it all, Jūsuke’s wife carried on alone to the house, where the first thing she came upon was her husband’s severed head, its eyes looking up at her in the blank stare of death. She screamed and threw herself to the floor, picking it up and cradling it in her arms. The midwife, who had been hurriedly summoned, separated the newborn from its mother. And so it was that Iwa came into the world.</p>
<p>The matter was very serious. When the coroner had arrived on the scene soon after, he listened to Mino recount in a frail voice what she knew. </p>
<p>“Please look into it thoroughly. My husband Densuke is not the kind of man to commit such a crime. Ask the neighbors; they know him. Last night he brought home three ryō he had been given by Takahashi Daihachirō, Geishū’s commissioner. He said it was for important services rendered, but I am sure Takahashi is the murderer. Examine the facts and show mercy…. As for me, I will have my own vengeance. I will hunt Daihachirō down through this life and the next seven to come….” </p>
<p>The veins in her eyes flushed with blood and her breast heaved as she struggled to breathe. The women around her gasped in alarm as Mino sank back in a pool of blood. She had died in issuing her curse. One of those present, a certain Tōkichi, broke the silence. </p>
<p>“I for one would never agree to become commissioner—not for my next seven lives.”</p>
<p>The others felt as he did. Even the coroner drew up his shoulders a bit at the frightening mask of the dead woman’s face. His investigation yielded very little. Before long, Kyūbei showed up and petitioned for the body of the mother and custody of the infant. The neighbors corroborated Mino’s story, but Densuke was nowhere to be seen. As for Daihachirō, he was unsure of his collaborator from the start and had already prepared to make a run for it even before Densuke’s discovery. No sooner had Densuke walked out of Geishū’s gate than Daihachirō took off with the seventy ryō he had pilfered from Jūsuke. A report was made to the town magistrate and an exhaustive search was undertaken It proved futile; no trace of either man was found. Kyūbei reported immediately to Tamiya Matazaemon on the child born under those direful circumstances. The old man awaited a reaction with his head bowed in reverence.</p>
<p>“The announcement of the child’s name will take place on the seventh night. Kyūbei must attend.”</p>
<p>He said no more. The birth of the infant Iwa, the granddaughter of a couple well into middle age, had earned his pardon for the offence of the parents.</p>
<p>5 The Incident at the Shiba Pass</p>
<p>It was 1695. Iwa, now a young twelve-year-old girl, was able to comprehend what people around here were saying. We Japanese are very precise and exacting in our dealings with each other. For tradesmen, this meant that the New Year must start with a clean slate, all bills issued and paid in full. The last night of the year, down to its final hours, finds them at their busiest and most anxious. Zensuke, the manager at the Shimaya dry goods shop, accompanied by a certain Jūgorō, was passing through a walkway cut into the mountainside known as the Shiba Pass. It was three o’clock in the morning. Since Jūgorō was the stronger of the two, the shopkeeper Jūrōzaemon had given him a short sword to guard Zensuke and the more than three hundred ryō in gold he carried with him. </p>
<p>“Where to next? It’s getting late,” said Jūgorō to the manager.</p>
<p>“As long as it’s the thirty-first day of the twelfth month, it’s never too late,” Zensuke replied tersely. “We have one more account at Nishikubo to settle, but we have to hurry.”</p>
<p>“You go on ahead,” said Jūgorō. “I need a minute to relieve myself.”</p>
<p>He drew apart about a hundred yards. They were in a residential area with many temples. The white walls of the houses blended into the carpet of snow on the ground. It was never a very busy place, but at this hour it was completely desolate. The high walls of the passageway with trees arching overhead on the path through the forest made it an ideal place for a holdup. Zensuke held back, slowing his pace to allow his companion to catch up with him, when he thought he saw something move in the dark. Suddenly, a samurai emerged from behind a tree just ahead and two others joined from the shadows. All three were hooded and wore visors.</p>
<p>“Stop where you are!”</p>
<p>Zensuke froze in his steps.</p>
<p>“What’s this suspicious-looking rascal doing around here at this hour? Probably some shop manager making off with his boss’s funds. All right then, hand them over for safe keeping. You poor fellow, you’ve really been caught this time.”</p>
<p>Zensuke took a step back, but the two men behind him blocked his retreat. He cried out and Jūgorō came running.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, this man is the manager of the Shimaya in Honjo. He is here to collect bills. I ask that you please leave him be.”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” bellowed the leader as he looked him up and down.</p>
<p>“Well, what do you know, another one from the same brood. Let’s have a look.”</p>
<p>He thrust his hand into Zensuke’s robes and fumbled around, roughing him up in the process. When Jūgorō tried to intervene, the two others held him back. He stood by terrified as the man dangled Zensuke’s money from his hand. It was obvious what was going on.</p>
<p>“My dear fellows,” Jūgorō broke in. “This is no laughing matter. We are not dishonorable men and we ask you to leave us be on our way.”</p>
<p>As he was speaking, the two assailants turned their attention to Zensuke, who was struggling to wrench himself free of the leader. They let down their guard just long enough for Jūgorō to draw his sword. His fighting skills were such that no one in his ward would risk taking him on. One man had tried and ended up with severe wounds on his scalp and face; another lost part of a hand. But Jūgorō was no match for these two trained soldiers, who promptly cut him down. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zensuke was shouting at the top of his lungs for help. In those days, there were special watchmen entrusted with guarding the crossroads. They were mainly older men no longer fit for active service. The regulations governing their watch were strict and they observed them closely, but like police today, they rarely left their posts to patrol the area. There was little hope that any of them would come to the rescue. But just then, the retinue of some lord passed near by. The leader of the bandits held fast to Zensuke with one hand, and with the other, shoved the money belt into his own robes. Now both hands were free to dispatch Zensuke to the underworld where Jūgorō would be waiting for him. Zensuke let out a startled cry.</p>
<p>“It’s Geishū’s men! There’s no time to lose!”</p>
<p>As the man pulled back, Zensuke sank his teeth deep into his hand. Howling in pain the bandit ran off, leaving behind a little finger in exchange for the three hundred and twenty-five ryō he had taken from Zensuke’s money belt.</p>
<p>The manager crouched down by the roadside, confused and upset. It was obvious that he had been the victim of some misfortune or other. One of the samurai stepped away from the retinue and walked over to investigate.</p>
<p>“Robbery and murder is it? Best leave it to the watchmen. It’s their affair.”</p>
<p>Zensuke moaned and groaned as he made his report. He was furious at the sight of these pampered watchmen warming themselves by the fire, and they knew it. But they just looked at each other and stared out into the snowy night, laughing at him with disdain. Why bother over a tradesman’s money belt? They questioned him offhandedly, as if to excuse themselves from taking any further steps. Surely the bandits were at the other end of Edo by now. Nevertheless, two of the watchmen accompanied Zensuke to the scene of the holdup. When they saw Jūgorō’s mangled corpse laying on the ground, one of them mused:</p>
<p>“He put up a good fight but lost out in the end. But maybe we got it backwards and it’s this fellow Zensuke we should be arresting for planning to run away with his master’s money.”</p>
<p>They took hold of Zensuke roughly and walked him back hurriedly to the guardhouse, where he spent hours tied up, anxious, and afraid. Luckily, the coroner showed up soon after. As it was the last day of the year, no official business would be carried out for the next three days. There was no way they could hold on to Jūgorō’s remains for that long, so a postmortem was duly performed. The body was promptly released to the Shimaya and Zensuke was set free. His testimony was put on the record, but it was not very helpful, since the hoods of the assailants prevented any proper description that might aid in identifying them. All Zensuke knew for sure was that he had left his mark on one of them and left him doubled up in pain from the wound. How were they to be run down? The coroner was upset and began to question the captain of the watchmen. “Why did you tie this man up? He is a tradesman and has all of his fingers, as does the dead man.”</p>
<p>The captain tapped the severed finger with his nightstick. Then everyone was dismissed and, to all appearances, the whole business was simply to be forgotten.</p>
<p>The Tokugawa government had its own plain-clothes police. One of the most famous was Magome Yaemon of Hatchōbori, whose grandfather had captured Marubashi Chūya, a key figure in the rebel­lion led by Yui Shōsetsu during the time of the fourth Shōgun Tokugawa Ietsuna. As the story goes, one day Magome, in the company of a ward officer named Kumagobei, was loitering around the poorer areas of Shitaya Hirokōji. They were disguised as charcoal vendors so as not to attract attention to themselves. All the legitimate practitioners of medicine and pharmacy were being looked into by the magistrate of the southern district, but Magome felt sure something else would turn up.</p>
<p>“Who’s that fellow over there?” he asked. Kumagobei smiled.</p>
<p>“He’s one of those shin-cutters. You can always tell these scoundrels by their rough dark blue cotton socks, coarse straw sandals, and banded leggings. And look at his long staff. They cut their own shins to demonstrate the effectiveness of the plasters they are hawking—guaranteed to staunch the flow of blood and cure all wounds. Say a man’s arm is hanging by a thread and blood is gushing out. All they have to do is apply the plaster; the blood stops at once and the arm heals. They do a thriving business, even among the samurai, hawking a shell or two filled with salve here and there. As for whether or not their plasters do any good….”</p>
<p>Magome was amused. They followed the man and soon came to a guardhouse. Magome turned to Kumagobei.</p>
<p>“Take that fellow over there in. We need to question him.”</p>
<p>The officer was taken aback.</p>
<p>“As you wish. It’s old Yamabayashi Yōgen.”</p>
<p>The man was brought into the guardhouse and Kumagobei addressed him officiously.</p>
<p>“Magome is here to talk with you. What have you been up to?”</p>
<p>The old man was unfazed.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he replied.</p>
<p>With the confidence of an upright and well-to-citizen, he stepped into the presence of Magome, who greeted him with a friendly and informal smile.</p>
<p>“Ah! So this is Yamabayashi Yōgen, the head of the shin-cutters. How’s business?”</p>
<p>“I could not be more grateful. As long as people are born with teeth and men and women crave each other’s company, there is a profit in it for me.”</p>
<p>“And plasters?”</p>
<p>“That is Tōkichi’s line. If you wish to question him, permit me to leave and bring him here to you at once.”</p>
<p>In no time at all, the straight haired, unshaven lowbrow Tōkichi was poking his head into the guardhouse at the pier.</p>
<p>“Excuse me. I am honored to be….”</p>
<p>The officer gave him a knowing and quizzical look.</p>
<p>“Keep quiet! Magome has some questions about your clients. Once he starts inquiring into your own dealings, you will have time enough to lie then. In the meantime, be sure and answer truthfully.”</p>
<p>With that dutiful advice, the officer led Tōkichi into Magone’s presence. Once more conscience spoke louder than caution. </p>
<p>“Honorable and merciful sir, kindly initiate your examination of my innocence.” </p>
<p>Magome laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“Lucky for you, it’s not about you. I want to know about your plasters. Who bought a plaster from you this past New Year’s? Careful how you answer. This is a very serious matter.”</p>
<p>Tōkichi paused for a moment to think.</p>
<p>“The first day of the New Year a man came to me and purchased a large amount of salve. Over the past three months, he has returned several times, though of late his visits are few and far between. He has had good things to say about the remedy, and rightly so. I never saw a hand with a more infected wound. He….”</p>
<p>“Age and appearance?” interrupted Magome. He was all ears at the prospect of a solid clue.</p>
<p>“Perhaps fifty, fair complexioned, tall, stout. From the way he carries himself, I would say he must at least be a vassal—either that, or someone trying to pass himself off as one.”</p>
<p>Who was this man? Magome felt sure that he was about to learn something of interest. Kumagobei was given his instructions.</p>
<p>“Go to this man’s shop every day and have him report to you. As for the suspect, be circumspect. Clearly he is no ordinary person. A samurai is to be summoned, not disgraced by arrest—if indeed he is a samurai.”</p>
<p>Taking along several assistants, Kumagobei set himself up in the rear of Tōkichi’s shop. Because the man had not put in an appearance for several weeks, the wait was sure to be over soon, though it was hard to predict when. On the twenty-fifth day of May he in fact showed up. Kumagobei recognized him at once from the description—even before Tōkichi, who was busy stuffing little shells with his miraculous salve—and knew at once what he had to do. The customer called out and Tōkichi turned away from his work.</p>
<p>“Good day, sir. And is the hand doing better?”</p>
<p>“The cure couldn’t be going better. This will probably be my last visit.”</p>
<p>The man appeared confused as Tōkichi bowed first to him then toward the rear of the establishment. He went on.</p>
<p>“Yes, the drug is everything you said it was. When my wound became infected, it looked for a time as if my whole hand, perhaps even my arm, would have to go. Those in-house doctors are notoriously bad. Nothing of theirs can surpass your remedy, my good druggist. Here, this should cover two shell-fulls of its powers.”</p>
<p>He held out a silver bu. As he set out to fill the order, Tōkichi looked to the back of the shop for some sign of the officer. After some delay, he handed the shells and a handful of copper change to his customer. No sooner had he left the shop than Tōkichi bolted for the rear. Kumagobei was gone. His assistants sat around calmly smoking their pipes and drinking Tōkichi’s low-grade tea.</p>
<p>Kumagobei had little trouble tracking his suspect to Okachi-machi in Shitaya. Once there, he found a general store that sold everything from tobacco to radishes, both of which gave off a strong smell but little fragrance. Kumagobei turned to the shopkeeper. “A question or two, if you will. This tall samurai, an older man who lives around here, who is he?”</p>
<p>Gōbei, the woman in charge, hesitated, but soon disdain overpowered discretion.</p>
<p>“The one with his hand wrapped in a bandage, you mean? His name is Sakurai Kichirō. He’s a bad one, he is. It’s one thing when he gets into it with those of own class, but even with his injury he’s been reported three times to the guardhouse. And each time he got away with it, the dreadful fellow. He never pays his debts, but woe to those who refuse him credit. He already owes nearly a ryō to our shop in Echigoya. We have had the misfortune of having to put up with him and his family these past six months.”</p>
<p>Kumagobei continued to question her.</p>
<p>“To be able to defend himself despite his injury means he must be an accomplished swordsman as well as a ruffian. Tell me, how did he get injured?”</p>
<p>“Can’t say I know. Probably some disturbance during the New Year festivities. Before then he was perfectly fine.”</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>“He has two friends, Kahei and Miemon. Those three are birds of a feather—and all of them look partly plucked. Perhaps they were fighting among themselves. If so, they seem to have made up. Sakurai is a match for both the others together.”</p>
<p>She looked at Kumagobei to see if he had any more questions, but he was nonchalantly picking out a strand of tobacco for himself.</p>
<p>“He once pushed me into a ditch near here. I’m lucky I wasn’t seriously hurt.”</p>
<p>Kumagobei was satisfied with his investigation and rushed back to tell his master. Magome’s eyes gleamed with enthusiasm, as did Kumagobei’s. Beyond a doubt, they had the bandits of the Shiba Pass.</p>
<p>Magome Yaemon rushed off to the office of the town magistrate, where his lordship Matsuda Genba listened to their report.</p>
<p>“Different problems require different solutions. I am somewhat familiar with two of these men. The third man is hard to figure and evidently not so easy to deal with.”</p>
<p>Two police constables and a civil official were dispatched at once to the location in question. To capture Nakagawa Miemon and Imai Kahei was not going to be easy. An additional band of twenty constables and officials was sent to Sakurai’s residence. Once they had it surrounded, one of the officers and his assistant entered unceremoniously.</p>
<p>“We have been sent with orders. The presence of Sakurai Kichirō is required at the office of the town magistrate. If we are met with resistance, we will be forced to use restraints. Kindly come with me now.”</p>
<p>Sakurai surmised the reason for the arrest.</p>
<p>“They’ve sniffed out the incident at the mountain pass. I knew there was something off today with that scoundrel of a druggist.”</p>
<p>The officer had planted himself directly in front of the sword rack, leaving Sakurai no means to kill anybody or cut his own belly. He turned to his wife.</p>
<p>“The matter at hand will take some explaining. I shall probably be away for some time. It’s already late in the day. Hey! Is that Kichitarō?”</p>
<p>A seven-year-old boy rushed into the room.</p>
<p>“You handsome little devil!… Dear sirs, I ask you to give me a minute. Our separation is not going to be brief. I won’t resist. We are in agreement on what comes next.… Tarō, don’t be impolite! Greet the gentleman properly.”</p>
<p>The boy obeyed, with a gravity and ceremony that did not cloak his hostility at having to go through the motions.</p>
<p>“Your father has to leave now. From now on you must obey your mother in all things. Keep that in mind or things will end badly.”</p>
<p>Frightened and weeping, mother and child threw their arms around him. Before letting go, he just had time to bend down and whisper to his wife Ren.</p>
<p>“In the vanity you will find a sealed scroll. Everything is explained there. Read it and then destroy it. Later, when you think the time is right, let our son know.”</p>
<p>He pushed the woman and boy aside brusquely and strode towards the entrance where the officer stood waiting. He laughed and flicked his wrist at him.</p>
<p>“I am not going to resist. We both know what comes next.”</p>
<p>The constables were ordered to stand down and grant him leeway.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the examination of the other two men was underway at Lord Matsuda’s office. The greater fool of the two, Nakagawa Miemon, was the first to be summoned into to the magistrate’s presence.</p>
<p>“Nakagawa, there is a small matter I need to ask you about. How did you come by those scars on your face? These appear to be from recent wounds. Examine your memory carefully now.”</p>
<p>His tone was menacing. Miemon was taken aback. He had been expecting a rebuke over some disturbance of the peace or other, which was not uncommon for men of his sort.</p>
<p>“Of course! Could they know about the incident at the Shiba Pass?”</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story, and a silly one at that. I don’t wish to take up your precious time with….”</p>
<p>Matsuda Genba cut him off with a brusque gesture.</p>
<p>“Answer the question, and answer it truthfully. You are not known either for your good judgment or for your sobriety.”</p>
<p>His ears perked up at the magistrate’s words as he saw a way for the doors of the jail to open wide and let him out. He was eager to talk.</p>
<p>“You are right. Saké never does a man any good, much less a samurai. That is why Kahei, Sakurai, and I all decided to swear it off forever. We were going to make a pilgrimage to Mt Konpira and take a vow of abstinence on holy ground. Everything was going well when we set out together from Nihonbashi. But alas, at Kyōbashi we were overcome by the sweet bouquet of alcohol. We had not yet pronounced our vows and were not on holy ground, so we thought we might have one last drink before carrying on. </p>
<p>“The grace of the Buddha was not with us. After we began, we adjourned to a nearby eatery where our drinking spree continued for the rest of the day. The saké spirited us away on the wings of a devilish goblin. We traveled the road to Mt Konpira in a daze. Along the way, Kahei and I had at it. Swords were drawn and we ended up injuring each other. These are the wounds you see on my head and face. Kahei nearly lost his hand. The tussle awakened Sakurai from his sleep and he jumped in to pull us apart. He is the kind of man you’re afraid of, but in my rage I sank my teeth into one of his fingers. A bite by a man or an animal can easily become infected, and indeed his wound ended up worse than either of ours.”</p>
<p>Matsuda let Miemon babble on as he conversed aside with his chamberlain. He was not very patient when he had something to say. Having barely paid attention to what was being said, he interrupted. </p>
<p>“When did this fight take place? What was the day you made your vow and set out for Mt Konpira? It’s probably some god you offended taking revenge against you.”</p>
<p>“The twelfth month, tenth day,” replied Miemon without hesitation. The magistrate ordered him to repeat his answer. He repeated the question several times, always in a slightly different words. Miemon, fool that he was, stuck fast to the date. </p>
<p>“Nakagawa Miemon,” said Matsuda, “you are a liar. And what’s more, a murderer. En route to the castle on the thirteenth I was speaking with your lord and learned that you had been sent on a mission. The reports about you were detailed and indicated that at the time you had no injuries… Restrain him and take him away.”</p>
<p>The officers fell on him from all sides. In no time at all he was tied up and carried out.</p>
<p>Imai Kahei was next to come forward. He was a sly fox, but also a coward. He hedged his answers to the magistrate’s questions, doing his best to muddle his story. What had Miemon said?</p>
<p>“He spoke of your eloquence and cleverness. He told us you would be the one to tell the tale properly. So let us now have the truth of what transpired.”</p>
<p>Matsuda’s reply was meant to flatter and Kahei, unable to contain himself, set sail on his sea of lies.</p>
<p>“We all like saké….”</p>
<p>“So, you are in agreement after all.”</p>
<p>Matsuda smiled pleasantly and Kahei took courage.</p>
<p>“But saké costs money. We went together to see Kuraya Jihei, a moneylender who, as is well known, lives on the slope in Kuramae.”</p>
<p>Matsuda nodded.</p>
<p>“We borrowed two ryō from him on agreement that we would pay with interest to the amount of ten ryō within a month’s time. We made off to the nearest drinking establishment and it wasn’t until eleven o’clock that night that we decided to return home. At Teobashi Bridge we ran into a band of drunkards who set on us without provocation. A struggle ensued and my hand was nearly severed. That is the truth.”</p>
<p>“And what was the date on this monetary contract of yours?”</p>
<p>Imai hesitated. On entering the building he had caught a glimpse of the drug seller Tōkichi and realized that his summons had to do with the incident at the Shiba Pass. He would have to push back the date of his injury.</p>
<p>“I don’t recall exactly. It could have been the seventeenth, the day before the Kannon festival.”</p>
<p>He was scared and swallowing his words. Matsuda spoke sharply, “Speak up. The seventeenth, you say?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. Sometime in the last ten days of the month. Maybe the nineteenth or twentieth, but no later than that.”</p>
<p>The magistrate almost leaped at him.</p>
<p>“You liar! On the last day of the year you were here to deliver to me in person an early New Year’s gift, and you had no such wound. And yet the following day the druggist sees you with a mangled hand. It was not at Teobashi but in the Shiba Pass that you were wounded.… Tie him up and take him out of here.”</p>
<p>The officials stepped forward. Imai made a feeble attempt to stand, but they threw him to the ground and in no time he was keeping company with Nakagawa Miemon.</p>
<p>Together with his officials, Matsuda braced himself to deal with the most difficult of the accused. At a glance the magistrate realized he had been mistaken about the man who stood before him. Sakurai Kichirō stepped forward with calm and dignity. After a formal greeting to the judge, he came at once to the point.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what lies Miemon and Kahei have been telling you. The fact is, the three of us plotted together to rob the manager of his fat purse as he made his rounds to settle accounts at the end of the year. This is how the manager of the Shimaya, Zensuke, lost his money belt and how another man from the same shop came to be killed. We are all three guilty of the murder….”</p>
<p>The magistrate raised his hand to halt the proceedings.</p>
<p>“Bring in the other two. You may go on, Kichirō.”</p>
<p>“Miemon was badly cut about the head and face. Kahei nearly lost his hand. I would have killed the manager, but Geishū’s retinue showed up and I was afraid someone would recognize me. As for the three hundred and twenty-five ryō we took….”</p>
<p>The eyes of Nakagawa and Imai stood out of their heads. They listened aghast at Kichirō’s confession. They had intended to deny the whole incident, but now they were overcome with rage.</p>
<p>“What! Three hundred and twenty-five ryō! And all we got was ten ryō apiece. Surely you jest, Sakurai…. What a wicked lowlife you are, you swine!”</p>
<p>Matsuda could not have asked for more. Smiling broadly, he turned to Kichirō to asked him politely why he kept three hundred ryō for himself and left his comrades with such a paltry sum?</p>
<p>“Because they don’t deserve any more. They’re pathetic, no better than common foot soldiers. But there is still more to tell, now that the story has come to an end. My real name is Takahashi Daihachirō, formerly a retainer of Matsudaira Aki no Kami. I was being pressured by Jūsuke the moneylender, so I killed him and had Densuke, the cook in the soldiers’ quarters at the residence, dispose of the body. This was in June of 1683. I fled arrest and I found employment as a calligraphy teacher at Yūki in the province of Shimosa. Densuke, who had also fled, showed up here one day as a wandering beggar. I was afraid he might not hold his tongue, so I killed him, too. Then I mutilated the corpse and threw it into the castle moat near by. He was taken for just another dead beggar and the matter was dropped.”</p>
<p>“When did that take place?” asked the magistrate.</p>
<p>“A year later in June.”</p>
<p>He shifted slightly. Nakagawa and Imai protested strongly at the details of Sakurai’s confession, but he turned back on them fiercely.</p>
<p>“Silence! A public trial would have brought shame on vassals throughout the land and spread fear among the public toward those of our class. We three planned the deed and stole the money.”</p>
<p>He put his arms behind his back. The officials approached softly and, almost with respect, bound him in ropes. With a wave of Matsuda’s hand, the guilty were taken away. Nakagawa and Imai had no other recourse than to confess and avoid further torture over what had become a hopeless case. Sentence was pronounced at a later date and all of them were condemned to death. Stripped of their status, the three were taken to the execution grounds in Shinagawa and there decapitated.</p>
<p>The wife of Takahashi Daihachirō did not need to wait for the trial to know what had happened. She already had her husband’s confession in her hands. By nightfall she had packed up and left with her son. When he reached the age of eight, Kichitarō was enrolled as a novice at the Jōshin-ji temple in Fukagawa. There he was given the name Myōshin and became the favorite of the chief priest. The mother, meanwhile, had been reduced to utter poverty. For a time, she worked as a madam in a brothel in the Honjo canal district and eventually was promoted to the rank of first concubine to her master Tōemon, the local leader in the trade. Her name was changed to Matsu. When Myōshin was thirteen years old, he heard that she had died. He had no more roots in the world save the goodly priest who became a second—and better—father to him. But virtue was in for its usual reward. At eighteen, an ordained monk and well versed in his priestly calling, Myōshin made off with the contents of the temple strong box and ran through fifty ryō with the wenches of Fukagawa Yagurashita. His prolonged absences aroused suspicion among the other monks, and the chief priest soon realized the truth about his unworthy disciple, the tainted issue of damaged stock.</p>
<p>6 The Marriage Broker</p>
<p>The presence of Iwa disrupted the household at Samon-chō. The services of a wet nurse were required and she brought a train of servants in with her. They stayed on as the child grew, and even increased in number. Iwa had become a young lady, and that meant she had a certain status to maintain. The miserly habits of Matazaemon were thrown to the winds with the arrival of his grandchild. The outward signs of affection he and his wife had denied the mother were lavished on the daughter. At the age of seven, Iwa contracted smallpox, a common affliction among children at the time. The symptoms first appeared on the anniversary of Mino’s death, obliging the family to abbreviate the ritual for her mother’s memorial service. Matazaemon was prepared to abandon all his duties to nurse the child to health himself. Naka loved Iwa not only as a daughter but for who she was. She had sense enough to exile the old man to a corner of the room and then out the door. Her protests eventually drove him back to his duties. Who, in those rigid and heartless times, would have accepted such an excuse to be absent from work? </p>
<p>The illness was worrisome for the young child and she did not come through it unscathed. Her grandmother, as mentioned earlier, was a competent nurse. Iwa, for her part, was a plain girl. She had the same flat plate of a face as her mother. She had small eyes receding behind swollen eyelids. Her hair was sparse and the disease had left conspicuous black pock marks on her fair skin. Other than that, she was spared its ravages. But there is more….</p>
<p>Iwa’s disposition more than compensated for her looks. She had one of those evenly balanced temperaments, matched by clear judgment and an uncommonly good nature. What is more, she possessed all the accomplishments and discipline befitting a lady. When she was eleven years old, Matazaemon reluctantly sought out and secured for her the position of lady-in-waiting in the great Hosokawa family. Iwa’s absence made no difference at home. The servants were retained and kept prepared for her return. The idea that she would be back with them soon—perhaps even tomorrow—may have been no more than the wishful thinking of an aging man. Naka went along with the unnecessary expenses and adjusted her habits accordingly. She was always one to acquiesce, though her own preference would have been to make a good housekeeper of Iwa, someone like herself, who can sew and cook, do the wash and clean the house—a kind of second Mino. She could not understand what Matazaemon was thinking.</p>
<p>Iwa grew into a young woman in the Hosokawa household, complementing everything she had learned at home with all the skills called for in her new position, from mastering the ways of etiquette and grace to the simple chores of housekeeping. She came as a plain child and developed into a plain woman, which may have been a blessing. The lady of the household was a jealous woman and her husband had a weakness for other women. He had his eye on every chambermaid for an amorous liaison. His wife tried to frustrate his wiles by assembling the most hideous collection of females her own family and her lord’s retainers could find. Iwa caught her attention from the start precisely because she was lacking in any physical attractiveness. Over the years the master tried to get used to her looks—and failed. He could not bring himself to make any first advances in her direction. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the girl’s admirable temper and good judgment had won over the esteem of the entire household. Iwa was charged as a substitute to perform the duties of her ladyship. For the first time in his life, the head of Oki Province had seen something more in a woman than her sex. When the time came for Iwa to leave the house, the lord and lady expressed their regrets in the form of parting gifts. Even so, his lordship had to admit defeat in that he had not found a single retainer willing to take Tamiya’s daughter to wife. In that sense, the mission had failed and Naka knew it. Matazaemon didn’t give it a second thought; he was just glad to have her back. He was pleased and grateful to accept the presents she brought with her. Iwa was home once again, like a lost jewel that had been found. She was, of course, their daughter, but she was also a very practical girl. The first thing to be done was to dismiss several of the servants who were no longer needed.</p>
<p>By now Matazaemon was advanced in age and sickly. As he neared his seventieth year, his one aim was to adopt a son to marry his daughter and assume the family name and inheritance. Iwa needed a spouse and the posterity of his house needed securing. As a young girl, Iwa had often had her suitors, but only in jest. Watanabe Jūzō, Natsume Kyūzō, and Imaizumi Jinzaemon, along with several other young scamps from Samon-chō and thereabouts, could not help amusing themselves with the little ogre. Iwa herself was oblivious to what was going on, and as a result even a little time with her was enough to disarm many a would-be tormenter. Most of her unseemly wooers came genuinely to like the girl, except for those deeply ingrained with a malicious and ugly disposition like Natsume and Akiyama Chōzaemon, who made sport of her in greater earnest. Nevertheless, as grown men none of them could face the prospect of taking the final step, and no parents were cruel enough to graft their unwilling stock to Iwa’s tree.</p>
<p>She was clever enough to realize all this with time. In 1709, at the age of twenty-six, she began to drop hints to Matazaemon until, at last he went to seek the help of Kondō Rokurobei. The man lived just behind the large temple enclosure of Sainen-ji, nestled on the slopes of a hill dipping steeply down to Samegabashi. The relationship between the two was distant at best, but the master of the Tamiya household was caught up in a deadly feud with close relatives, his brother Yoemon in particular. In such circumstances, he could hardly turn to them to find Iwa a husband.</p>
<p>And so it happened that one August day Rokurobei was awaiting a visit from Yamada Chōbei. He knew really very little about the man, except that he had once been a resident in the ward. After a series of ups and downs, he had taken up dealing in metals—and just about anything else that came his way—in a shop that bore the sign “Musashiya.” He was widely known throughout Edo for his various connections and struck Rokurobei as a quick and easy way to dispose of the arduous task Matazaemon had imposed on him. </p>
<p>Chōbei did not keep him waiting long. As someone whose life was carried on the wind, any offer seemed a gift from the gods. It had earned him the nickname “Chōbei the Windmill,” which suited him perfectly. Like the toy paper windmills made for children, he spun erratically from one thing to another without commotion. The maid announced his arrival unceremoniously.</p>
<p>“Wait here a moment…. Master, Chōbei the metal dealer is here to see you.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Let him in at once.… Chōbei, is it? Please sit down.”</p>
<p>Chōbei followed closely on the maid’s footsteps. She drew aside to make room for him and then flitted out in haste. In those days, poverty and loathing carried little weight in Yotsuya. She could almost smell them on the man.</p>
<p>Chōbei looked in envy at the comfortable surroundings of Rokurobei. He stood there in the summer swelter, his thin gown fallen to his waist. Rokurobei sat in a light shirt and breeches looking out on the garden with its large shade trees, shrubbery, and landscaped rocks. Everything was kept moist by a servant diligently splashing water this way and that. Tea was brought in and Kondō was reminded that he had a guest. As he turned around, Chōbei addressed him.</p>
<p>“It has been some time since I last paid you a visit. Pardon the intrusion.”</p>
<p>Chōbei sighed but the irony was lost on his corpulent host. Rokurobei seemed hesitant, unsure just how to introduce the reason for the summons. Chōbei continued.</p>
<p>“And how is your health? Is it good? Is it a business matter of some importance on which you have called me here?”</p>
<p>Rokurobei drew back at the directness of the question. And then he, too, let out a sigh. Chōbei was renowned for his awe-inspiring greed. He would do anything for the right sum. Kondō recalled that he had once been known in the ward as “Chōbei the Blind.” But he was also attached to money. It brought him such comfort and he hated to part with comfort. The question before them was how much of Kondō’s hard-earned commission he would be willing to part with. That thought alone brought him to his senses.</p>
<p>“It’s a question of finding a groom and I am the one charged with the task. The idea is to adopt a son from outside the ward into the family. Since no one has as many contacts as you or is in a better position to find the right candidate, I wish to ask your advice.”</p>
<p>Chōbei breathed in between his teeth. Outside the ward? Something was up here, he thought to himself, and there’s money to be made if I keep my wits about me.</p>
<p>“Surely there are enough young fellows in Samon-chō to find a suitable groom among them. Of course, if there’s a hitch….”</p>
<p>“It’s the Tamiya daughter, Iwa. Master Matazaemon has commissioned me to deliver them a son-in-law.”</p>
<p>Chōbei whistled through his breath.</p>
<p>“For Iwa!…”</p>
<p>“She’s no beauty, as you evidently know. But wealth can make up for her shortcomings. In any case, I’m asking for your help.”</p>
<p>“For how much?”</p>
<p>Chōbei did not mince words. Rokurobei may have forgotten who he was dealing with, but Chōbei did not. He went on.</p>
<p>“It’s not easy to fix a price for damaged goods. Fortunately, the damage is only on the surface…. Shall we say ten ryō?”</p>
<p>Kondō laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>“And they call you Chōbei the Blind! It seems to me you see things quite clearly. The entertainment of watching you collect a fee from the happy bridegroom would almost be reward enough.”</p>
<p>Chōbei’s tone was serious. “I envy you your future with all your wealthy connections. My future is here and now. I cannot afford to do the job for anything less.”</p>
<p>Throughout the long exchange that followed Chōbei maintained his composure. In the end, he emerged with a partial victory: half the sum he had initially asked for in payment for his services.</p>
<p>Chōbei began his search at once. The next day he made his way to the metals market in Kanda. While haggling over the price of things he never intended to buy, he worked in a word about his real purpose. “Hey, do any of you have any samurai drifters in your circle of acquaintances? I’m on the lookout for a fine, handsome fellow who is after a wife. Applications are open. Jinzaemon, you must have a candidate.”</p>
<p>“Not for the kind of wife you’d be offering.”</p>
<p>Everyone roared with laughter at the comeback. Without blinking an eye, Chōbei continued.</p>
<p>“This one is no mean proposition. She’s rich with an income of thirty sacks of rice, comes with a fine estate, and is a mere twenty-five years old. That means her man must pass for a suitable samurai; he has to be able to read and write as well as perform official duties. He must not be a boy but neither do we want an old-timer who can no longer do what is expected of him. Come now! Is there no one to step forward with a suggestion? I know there are qualified men among the unemployed. A ryō if you help me.”</p>
<p>“Not enough,” retorted Jinzaemon.</p>
<p>“A samurai without a master needs to be handled carefully. Meeting with their kind often ends up costing you and your companions your lives that very day. They can be every bit as quick-tempered as samurai in service to a lord.”</p>
<p>Jinzaemon spoke with the bluntness of a true son of Edo. His kind were not farmers or country folk but came from the same stock as Chōbei’s Banzū-in guild. He was joking, but the subject caught the attention of the crowd. One of them spoke up.</p>
<p>“Will you get that ryō out of the groom or out of the bride? She must be a sassy hag not to be married at her age. And none too chaste, I should imagine, eh, Chōbei? She could be a ready-made wife with a child in hand or on the way. Or have I got it backwards? Maybe she has been tried and found wanting? Is she sterile or deformed? Do you take us for fools?”</p>
<p>Chōbei chose his words carefully, “Yes, she is a bit ugly. Her face is round and flat and shiny, with black pock marks that make it look like speckled pumice and arouse suspicions of leprosy. But that’s not the point. She is still a woman.”</p>
<p>By now everyone was howling with laughter.</p>
<p>“A veritable beauty, indeed! Just the one for Chōbei to be peddling! Your words are too sugary. You’d hawk anything. But in this market, we deal in hard cash, not credit. The goods you’re selling sound a bit too worn even for you to pawn off.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true!” Chōbei was furious. “At the first hint of a threat to your supply of saké or access to other pleasures, there’s none of you who wouldn’t turn to me for help. Sisters, daughters, wives, aunts, why even mothers—you’d have me put them all up for sale.”</p>
<p>He was choked with rage.</p>
<p>“Sell her? I can and I will.”</p>
<p>Indignant at the inclusion of the last item in Chōbei’s list of marketable goods, someone nearby gave him a sharp poke in the back. Others began to voice their irritation and Chōbei feared things would escalate beyond mere words. He heard mention of the canal and that was enough for him to take the hint. He wasn’t about to hang around for a dousing. He stalked off briskly and headed for his tenement at Asakusa Hanakawado. He decided to avoid the metals market for the time being, regretting his fit of ill temper. After all, his trade only flourished when he was able to cash in on the needs of others.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, Chōbei the Windmill was a flesh-peddler for the licensed quarters of Yoshiwara and elsewhere. His other occupations were mere supplementary channels to that one enterprise. The demand would rise and fall with the seasons. Just now he was in a period of decline. His eagerness to see the Tamiya affair through sharpened. Pushing his way through Asakusa Kuramae, a glint of hope suddenly shone in his eyes. He turned sharply to the roadside where a small stand had been set up in the ditch and covered with boards to protect it from the stream of humanity flowing overhead. Inside was a table with several books, a container of water, writing brushes, paper scrolls for writing, and a box of divining sticks—the working tools of an itinerant fortune-teller. Chōbei could see that the man was busy gathering up his things to leave and lost no time in speaking up.</p>
<p>“It looks as if the heat of the day has fogged up your vision into the future, Kazuma Sensei. Are you abandoning your clients to their fate, or is it they who have abandoned their Sensei? I invite you to accompany me, if you will. Perhaps I, too, have a fortune to tell. At any event, my wife has been alerted and will have a bath waiting to reinvigorate the both of us.” </p>
<p>The young man laughed and nodded assent as he hastily finished packing up.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Chōbei. I suppose I only have to consult my own prophetic gifts to know where my future lies. No one wants to pay for the future when money for the present is so scarce. Besides, we’re here in the bowery where no one is eager to hear his luck will take a worse turn than it already has. The fools have all died; only their soothsayer survives.</p>
<p>Kazuma picked up the light bundle he had prepared and tossed it over his shoulder. The two stepped out into the street where they made their way through the crowd, quickening their pace as they headed for the great temple gate. Despite the rush, Chōbei managed to steal a look at his companion from time to time, encouraged at the obvious seediness that shone transparently through his handsome features. The two were neighbors in a row of houses in Hanakawado, a poverty-stricken district that lay along the river near the sprawling licensed quarters and provided residence for workers employed in more menial labor. On arriving home, Chōbei announced himself. “Taki, Taki! Is the bath ready? Yanagibara has honored us with his company. Prepare a warm welcome for him…. Please, step right in.”</p>
<p>Kazuma stepped out of his clogs in the vestibule and entered. “Pardon the intrusion. I’m sorry to drop in on you so unexpectedly, especially since I have been such a poor neighbor to the two of you.”</p>
<p>Taki smiled sheepishly at the unmistakably handsome young man. That year, 1709, Yanagibara Kazuma had turned twenty-one. Taki, already in her thirties, was more appreciative of masculine beauty than ever. Chōbei grumbled at the heat and the slightest trace of discomfort. He had his limits, even it if affected his business. He quickly shook off his robe and squatted in his breech cloth, fan in hand.</p>
<p>“This heat is just too much! And it’s bad for business—from Yoshiwara to Yotsuya.”</p>
<p>Taki looked up at the mention of Yotsuya. He went on, “You go first, Kazuma. Please, your bath is waiting, is it not?”</p>
<p>His wife nodded. Kazuma followed Chōbei’s example and in no time was as naked as the day his mother bore him. At once Chōbei began to voice his admiration.</p>
<p>“What a splendid fellow! Ah, what a waste! If Kazuma were a woman, he would make both of us rich…. Taki, look at his skin. It has the texture of the finest paper. What a pity!”</p>
<p>He drew back, the better to take in the totality of his guest’s appeal. Taki drew closer with the same intentions.</p>
<p>“Clearly Kazuma is not a woman. An error of nature that is! Somehow the age at which a woman becomes useful is the same age at which a boy becomes a burden, good for nothing but storytelling…. And you, Taki, what are you up to?”</p>
<p>His beloved was already half-undressed. She protested.</p>
<p>“Someone has to attend to our visitor in the bath. How can he wash his own back and shoulders? Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>“You shameless hussy!” Chōbei bellowed. “He doesn’t need your help. Why, you…! Taki, your skin is so dark one could mistake you for a lump of coal. No, with your belly and backside, more like two lumps of coal lying in a box. Our visitor can do without help from such an ugly jade. I’ll see to his needs, and with more skill and concentration than a woman.”</p>
<p>Kazuma politely intervened in the quarrel that had broken out between husband and wife.</p>
<p>“Please, it doesn’t matter. I appreciate your kind offers, but I’m fine. I have long arms.”</p>
<p>He stretched out his gangling, slender, almost simian limbs. They were the one proportional defect of an otherwise flawless physique. The altercation between Chōbei and Taki cooled down at his pleasant smile.</p>
<p>When the visitor sat down after his bath for a cup of tea, Chōbei changed the subject. “I, too, once claimed to be a fortune-teller. And you—don’t deny it—were once a monk.”</p>
<p>Kazuma looked at him with surprise, not to say misgivings. Chōbei went on. </p>
<p>“The way you pick up the cup gives you away—holding it in both hands, waving it slightly and shaking your head. The dust of the monk’s robes still clings to you.”</p>
<p>“You are a clever fellow,” said Kazuma. “It’s true. At one time I was a monk.”</p>
<p>“And where might that have been?” queried Chōbei.</p>
<p>“At a temple near Reigan in Fukagawa,” replied the fortune-teller.</p>
<p>“Aha, the Reigan-ji temple! And then you decided to return to the life of a samurai. Your posture and manner could only have been acquired in good company, and do doubt you are looking to regain your former status. As for me, I was not always as you see me now. Saké, women, and gambling turned me into a whore monger. Paying for geisha and prostitutes gets more expensive when they involve the other two vices. Wife, status, fortune—all gone. Such has been my fate.”</p>
<p>“You’re not the first,” grumbled his womanizing comrade. “And your wife, what has become of her?”</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with Taki. It’s no longer an issue. Anyway, do you think this jade would be jealous?”</p>
<p>He glowered at her.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Kazuma, listen to me. I not only tell fortunes, I can make them.”</p>
<p>Kazuma laughed. “Stop joking with me. Your line of work has already cost me my fortune and my social position….”</p>
<p>“Only for me to offer you a better one. You’re a samurai without a master, but you have an education and you’re a good looking man. Perfect qualifies for a husband.”</p>
<p>“What, in some tradesman’s family?” the samurai replied arrogantly.</p>
<p>“No,” replied Chōbei eagerly. “I foresee a return to your own social class.”</p>
<p>“And at what cost?” Kazuma inquired coolly. “The honor of a samurai cannot afford a public scandal. I have no desire for a speedy suicide just to save someone in a predicament. Has the woman gone astray? Is her father’s sword dull?”</p>
<p>“Nothing of the sort,” replied Chōbei. “The parents—or I should say, grandparents—are proud fools. The girl is twenty-five years old, rich, and, I have to admit, not very good looking. It was by mere chance, through a former connection, that the affair fell into my lap. As you well know, this kind of thing is not really up my line, but let’s share the good luck together.”</p>
<p>“Is she a monster, one of those pop-eyed freaks with a neck that expands and contracts?”</p>
<p>“The answer to that will have to wait until you meet her,” answered Chōbei cautiously.</p>
<p>“She is somewhat pock-marked. You know what I mean; this kind of thing happens. Anyway, things being what they are, you are the only reliable person I can recommend. I beg you, don’t turn me down.”</p>
<p>“Rich and the granddaughter of people up in years?”</p>
<p>He eyed Chōbei quizzically and the latter nodded back in agreement.</p>
<p>“Whatever her looks, I accept your offer—unless of course this turns out to be one of your little jokes.”</p>
<p>Chōbei cleared his throat. “There will of course be a commission in it for me….”</p>
<p>“I see. Then the proposal is rock-solid after all. As for your commission, you have my word, even though I’m not a wealthy man and am a little short on funds right now.”</p>
<p>“You won’t be for long. At ten ryō, I tell you, it’s a bargain.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” replied the fortune-teller absentmindedly. “You will be reimbursed….</p>
<p>“Upon delivery of the goods,” Chōbei chimed in, by now all smiles.</p>
<p>“Of the stretch-necked monster, you mean,” laughed Kazuma as he prepared to take his leave. The two planned to meet up the following day at the house of Kondō Rokurobei in Yotsuya.</p>
<p>7 The Arrival of Iemon</p>
<p>Kondō Rokurobei could only hope that somehow Chōbei would manage to see his difficult mission through. It was with no small delight that he received the news of his visit the following morning. The maid was a bit more restrained. “Let’s just wait and see.” </p>
<p>Kondō was unable to contain his excitement as he greeted Chōbei. Tea was served and the two men faced each other over the cups. To Kondō’s inquiring look, Chōbei began.</p>
<p>“Good sir, the task you have set me is a difficult one.” He recounted his experience at the Kanda market and Kondō began to grow flustered. Perhaps he had misjudged the point of the visit. </p>
<p>“A difficult task,” Chōbei continued, “but not impossible. Surely five ryō is too small a price for my efforts.” </p>
<p>Kondō’s eyes lit up. Chōbei had found his man!</p>
<p>“But it is all I am authorized to offer. You know Tamiya. In the end, he is the one who pays, so you should take the matter of your share up with him. But there’s no rush. If things go badly with him, Naka will be much easier to deal with… unless of course Yoemon starts meddling in the affair.”</p>
<p>His face twisted and Chōbei mirrored the expression back to him. Kondō continued.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to have troubled you. The parents of Natsume Kyūzō show signs of breaking off negotiations and siding with us. This was only yesterday, after they heard that I had taken the Iwa matter firmly in hand.”</p>
<p>Now it was Chōbei’s turn to feel anxious. Is this why Kondō was so cheerful? Had he misread him on entering the house? He raised a hand as if to stop his host from talking.</p>
<p>“Please consider our previous arrangement settled. I don’t want any renegotiating of the terms to put you in an awkward position. I have already found your man and he is on his way. I’m sure even you will be pleased.”</p>
<p>“Who is he?” questioned Kondō.</p>
<p>“One Yanagibara Kazuma. He has been doing fortune-telling at Asakusa….</p>
<p>“A charlatan? A quack? Chōbei, are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p>Kondō edged back on his cushion and withdrew from the suggestion in panic. He didn’t even mention Natsume Kyūzō. Chōbei smiled. He had been caught out, but so had Kondō.</p>
<p>“Don’t be alarmed. The man is a masterless samurai. His fortune-telling is of little account, no more than a temporary solution to a stressful situation. You will soon be able to judge the man himself from his appearance. Let’s drop the whole matter of Kazuma and any consideration of Natsume. Our contract stands.</p>
<p>Kondō looked down, slightly offended. Chōbei tried to reassure him.</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth, I cannot vouch for this man completely. For now, please go along with my plan and accompany me to Matazaemon’s. Kazuma must not be allowed to see Iwa at this time. Master Tamiya has been ill and out of circulation of late. His old wife has enough sense to do as she is told; that much the years have drilled into her. As for Iwa, we will say that she has caught a cold, that her hair is a mess and she would not think of showing herself. Make this clear when the time comes to bring out the saké. For the time being, see that she is sent off on some errand to Akiyama’s house or to the Imaizumi newly-weds.”</p>
<p>“But the man must see the girl,” protested Kondō.</p>
<p>Chōbei replied, “He must see the estate. That is what I intend to enamor him with. He is not to see the girl until she is his wife. He will hold on to her in order to keep the estate. Trust me. I know what is in men’s hearts—at least what’s in Yanagibara Kazuma’s heart.”</p>
<p>Perhaps he had been too direct. Kondō Rokurobei felt a final pang of conscience. </p>
<p>“Chōbei, what manner of man is it that you’re bringing us? What is his true character? Tamiya is as upright as the walls in the inner palace of the Edo Castle. And Yanagibara Kazuma….”</p>
<p>Chōbei’s brow wrinkled. The maid’s announcement spared him from having to answer. </p>
<p>“Yanagibara Kazuma wishes to see you, sir.”</p>
<p>“Show him in at once,” replied Kondō.</p>
<p>He stood up, partly out of surprise, partly out of courtesy. Kazuma cut a striking figure as he entered the room. His robes, white as Satsuma porcelain, were of the finest quality and perfectly tailored. His outer cloak was made of Akashi crepe corduroy. Tucked into his sash were exquisitely lacquered scabbards with the narrow swords that were in vogue at the time. He was tall and fair-skinned with a high forehead and prominent nose. His every movement was smooth, agile and muscular like a cat. Kondō gasped as he exchanged greetings with the visitor.</p>
<p>“This man for Iwa? Good heavens! The fox has stolen a jewel.”</p>
<p>Kondō’s misgivings and discretion melted away at the apparition before him. Kazuma gracefully excused himself for intruding uninvited. Kondō brushed the apology aside stuttering and in obvious delight at the chance to meet Yanagibara Kazuma. Chōbei smiled to himself. He could hardly contain his relish at seeing Kondō’s pointed objections so summarily dulled. The young man easily bested the others at keeping his composure in what was a most awkward situation. To Chōbei’s relief and astonishment, he showed himself to be mature well beyond his years .</p>
<p>“Wherever did you get hold of such a splendid outfit? Could it be that you really are a magician?”</p>
<p>Kazuma was not about to enlighten Chōbei or anyone else on his secret. After some small talk, the discussion turned to the purpose of the meeting. Kondō was the first to broach the subject. </p>
<p>“I must apologize for troubling you, but the matter at hand may be of some advantage to you. The lady is the daughter of Tamiya Matazaemon, a constable held in esteem by the Hosokawa family. It would be my honor to present you to the Tamiya family in Yotsuya.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary. The honor of meeting with you is as great as my intrusion has been undignified. I beg your pardon for my indiscretion.”</p>
<p>Kondō quickly parried the apology as Chōbei stepped in. </p>
<p>“Well, now that the introductions are over, the matter seems as good as settled. Master Tamiya is not feeling well and he is not expecting us. Perhaps it would be best if you were to go ahead first and see how things stand at the Tamiya household.”</p>
<p>Kondō agreed. He bade the gathering farewell and headed out for Samon-chō, bubbling over with excitement and praying that the business would turn out as he had hoped. If so, it would set him up for life in the good graces of the wealthy Tamiya family. He had too much at stake not to say a prayer along the way here and there at the temples and shrines that lined the road.</p>
<p>Some time after Kondō was gone, Chōbei and Kazuma set out, chatting as they walked along. “Congenial surroundings,” Chōbei remarked of the Kamiya neighborhood. He grinned and waved a hand at the long line of temple buildings and graveyards they were passing.</p>
<p>“Not much to savor at your current lodgings in Hanakawado, eh? Even I can see the difference.”</p>
<p>He stopped opposite the Kenshō-ji temple and looked across the way. The fruit was already beginning to ripen on the trees in Matazaemon’s garden.</p>
<p>“Persimmons, at 375 grams each: that means twenty cartloads of profit for the household in the fall.”</p>
<p>As they passed through the entrance to Samon-chō he pointed to a storehouse.</p>
<p>“Stuffed with rice from the Tamiya farms in Kazusa and not a husk in the lot.”</p>
<p>“Who said there were?” Kazuma replied testily. His eyes took in the wide panorama of the garden and the sweeping roof and eaves of the stately residence. As they passed along the hallway that led to the sitting room, Chōbei called his attention to the latticed work between the rooms, the panelled ceilings, and the exquisite woodwork of the alcoves. A hanging scroll painted in the clear, strong lines of the Kanō school hung in the sitting room alcove. Beneath it stood a beautifully arranged vase of flowers.</p>
<p>Matazaemon did not yet have full use of his legs but he had full mobility in his hands. He knew nothing of the two visitors who stood before him, least of all about Chōbei. Kondō stepped into the room accompanied by an elderly lady. Naka knelt down and bowed deeply to her prospective son-in-law. She was all in a flutter over the handsome man intended for Iwa. His exemplary politeness and the gentle softness of voice quite robbed her what little judgment she had remaining. Her only fear was that he would turn his back on the Tamiya family.</p>
<p>“Asakusa is some distance away,” said Chōbei. Might not your daughter do us the honor of serving some saké?”</p>
<p>The old woman hummed and hawed. Kondō, too, seemed put out.</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, Iwa is not presentable. She has caught a cold and is laid up in bed. But perhaps you might try to persuade her, seeing that Yanagibara is already here.”</p>
<p>Naka popped up, like a jack-in-the box whose spring had been released. She disappeared, only to return with the same news.</p>
<p>“She can be stubborn like a little girl sometimes, as you may well imagine! It’s not her illness that bothers her so much. Her hair is not made up and she wouldn’t dream of showing herself in such a state. She can be so vexing at times.…”</p>
<p>“Not so,” Chōbei stepped up in her defense. “She could not show higher regard for a future husband than by refusing to appear before him unkempt and not properly attired. Consider it a guarantee of the way she will conduct herself when married. She is to be commended for such a show of respect. All women like to look their best. A man shows up in the neighborhood, and out come the rice powder and rouge. Do you think they would forget about something as difficult to manage as hair? Trust me, when it comes to women, I know.”</p>
<p>He spoke well, Naka thought to herself, but like most men, full of himself. Kazuma looked out onto the beautiful garden. He took the chance to smile, having already figured out that Kondō knew too little about his agent to realized what a quick-tempered and think-skinned fellow Chōbei was. Still, he was a little put out at not seeing his would-be bride. At the first chance, he stepped out for a better look at the house and its surroundings. Chōbei came up to him in the hallway. His voice was smooth and wheedling.</p>
<p>“Is this not a fine prospect—for Master Kazuma?” His voice hovered on the word master.</p>
<p>“You cannot afford to let this splendid piece of good luck slip by. I have taken an interest in these neighbors of mine for some time now. Such a beautiful exterior deserves stability on the inside. Marry Iwa and you become the master of Tamiya. Agreed?”</p>
<p>Kazuma bent his head in thought. At his age, one’s ideals regarding the opposite sex are hard to put aside. </p>
<p>“You mean without even seeing the lady…. Is she so horrible?”</p>
<p>Chōbei protested. “Not at all! Think of her as one of the furnishings that go well with this fine house, this beautiful garden, and these overflowing storehouses. Look, Tamiya is a man who has twice what he needs. The property has tenement houses for attendants that have long stood empty, and he refuses to rent them out. It would bring so much revenue to the house, enough to make up for the unstable income from what the old man brings in as a teacher of flower arrangement and the tea ceremony.”</p>
<p>Kazuma looked around, his eyes following the sweep of Chōbei’s finger. His situation was desperate. The only future he could see for himself was to be adopted into this family as a son-in-law. No matter what the woman turned out to look like, there were compensations. His reply was a direct as Chōbei’s question had been: “Yes.”</p>
<p>Arrangements for the marriage proceeded without delay. Chōbei had struck his mark. Kazuma was so impressed with the surroundings, especially after a return to his own miserable quarters, that the appointment for a formal interview had to wait for an inspection of his future property. Within the week he had moved into Kondō’s house, where he was introduced to his future associates in the ward at a series of those fish and saké dinners that we Japanese are so fond of. The neighbors were dumfounded at the future son-in-law of the Tamiya. This man was to be the husband of the ogre? Was he mad, or just drunk? Perhaps it was the saké, since neither they nor Kazuma had barely known a sober moment since the celebrating began.</p>
<p>Of course, he would have to be presented to Matazaemon, the other principal involved. As Kondō carefully explained, no fixed date could be set for the interview. Tamiya had been too ill to consider it. As misfortune would have it, on the very day a time for the meeting had been set, Iwa received an urgent summons from the lady of the Hosokawa house. There was no way she could refuse, and once again her absence was accepted without further ado by all involved. Kondō certainly made no effort to find another occasion to meet in the three days that remained before they were formally to be wed, and Kazuma did not even hint at it.</p>
<p>In the evening the guests gathered in the reception rooms of the Tamiya home. Kondō and his wife joined Iwa and Iemon (the new name under which Kazuma has been officially registered as a member of the Tamiya family) in a private room. Chōbei had seen to procuring the padded hood of silk floss that the bride traditionally wears on this great occasion in her life. Iemon could not make out any details of what lay within the shadows of the headdress except for the shining light of her countenance. Was it perhaps joy? His curiosity was soon to be satisfied. Nine times—three cups poured three times and drunk in three sips—the saké cups were raised. Kondō Rokurobei took the hands of the couple and joined them together, exhorting them to mutual forbearance and calling on Iwa to promise unquestioning obedience to her husband. Strange as it seemed in this case, he prattled on about the maxims of Kaihora Ekken’s Instructions for the Traditional Education of Children, just as he had at twenty other marriages, apparently with favorable results. By the way, Ekken’s book, a comparatively recent guide for women, was no more than a few decades old.</p>
<p>To be sure, the role of a go-between was not an easy one. There was always the danger of ending up in difficulties with one of the families involved. Kondō was reassured on this score by the fact that the families had presented fewer complications than usual. But he had one lingering doubt, and it was about to be put to the test. Readying himself for the impending crisis, he cast an eye onto the veranda to make sure that Chōbei was on hand as promised. At his nod, the strings of the headdress were loosened and the covering that had so far concealed the face of Iwa was drawn back.</p>
<p>Iemon sprung to his feet and then hurried to sit back down again, mumbling some excuse, his hands trembling. He could not take his eyes off the white glow of the face before him, the smooth, glazed surface bespeckled with black pock marks. The removal of the hood had disturbed the arrangement of her hair somewhat, making the broad expanse of her forehead more prominent and drawing attention to her heavy, puffy eyelids in whose recesses her eyes shone like two tiny dots. Indeed, as Chōbei would later describe it, her eyes and eyelids had the appearance of a dumpling filled with dark bean paste and covered with a starchy glaze of arrowroot flour. Never had Iwa shown herself in such a bad light. She was busy removing her white robe to display the proper attire of a bride and wife. Iemon took advantage of the interval to step out onto the veranda. As he did so, Kondō winked to Chōbei who stepped forward so that Iemon almost ran into him. The young man seized him by the arm. His voice was agitated and he spoke in a whisper, fumbling for words. Chōbei was relieved to see that he was frightened, not angry.</p>
<p>“What is that? Who is that creature?” were the first words to come out of Iemon’s mouth. </p>
<p>At first, Chōbei spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“That is Iwa, the wife of Tamiya Iemon and daughter of Matazaemon, to be known as your spouse for generations to come.”</p>
<p>Then his tone turned rough. </p>
<p>“Don’t be a fool, Iemon. What do people know about a cow or a horse before they buy it? Its true qualities only show up later. Iwa is ugly, that much I give you. Her face is pock-marked and she’s a bit stoop-shouldered. But if the daughter of the wealthy Tamiya with all this splendid property had been a great beauty, you would never have become the son-in-law and future owner of his riches. What qualifications do you bring to such a position? A fortune-teller, a man whose pedigree surely would not stand up to careful examination.”</p>
<p>He looked intently at Iemon, and noted with satisfaction that these last words had hit home. Chōbei knew he would have to learn more about this Iemon, formerly known as Kazuma. He made up his mind to do so in good time. For the moment, he continued in the same vein.</p>
<p>“Pulling out at this juncture would only create a scandal. Matazaemon is not wanting for friends in high places and such a step would be sure to cause them grave displeasure. Someone would have to avenge the insult. And then there’s one more thing to consider. Anxiety over seeing his granddaughter settled in life and the line of the Tamiya house assured is what has been keeping the old man alive. He will die within the month. If his old lady hangs on too long….”</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment and then picked up his train of thought stone-faced. </p>
<p>“Give her lizards to eat. As a soothsayer, you have surely figured out Kondō Rokurobei by this time. He will never disadvantage the one who holds the purse of the house of Tamiya in his hands. You and Iwa will be left alone. Good luck to you, honorable sir, in your dealings with him. You may consider me a counsellor and friend in such matters, one who is by no means lacking in worldly experience. As for the woman, she is your wife and will step up to take charge of the household and see to your affairs. Where else could you find such a hard-working caretaker as Iwa at such a cheap price? Take a concubine. I’ll buy you one who will be the object of envy and desire among all the young men in Edo. My connections in these matters are exceptional. Come, let’s return to the light! At least we have nothing to hide.”</p>
<p>Iemon did not take the hint. One image kept turning over and over in his mind: not only is she completely off-kilter, she’s a leper! There was despair and determination in his eyes as they fastened on Chōbei, and such a frightened look that even Chōbei felt pity for him. He set one foot into the room and then suddenly turned back.</p>
<p>“Wait, that’s not so—absolutely not.”</p>
<p>Iemon was taken in by the seriousness of Chōbei’s voice. </p>
<p>“I admit, the scars left by smallpox were not minor. They were formed during healing, much the same as happens with serious burns. But there’s not a touch of leprosy in the woman.”</p>
<p>He was relieved to see Iemon sigh deeply. He took it as a sign that an immense weight had been lifted from the young man’s mind.</p>
<p>“Enough! Let the future come as it may. For now, enjoy the present. You don’t have to worry about Iwa growing ugly with age, and that’s got to count for something.. What difference will it be to you thirty years from now how she looks? She’s a woman, so make a child with her. Then you are free to look around elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Chōbei began placing lamps here and there as a sign to Kondō that all was well. Kondō entered with the other guests to offer their congratulations to the Tamiya house on being entrusted once more to young and vigorous hands. When the time came, Iemon himself gave the signal to retire.</p>
<p>What happened next between him and his bride is a matter over which the society draws a veil of decency. In the morning Iwa arose early to attend to the matutinal needs of her spouse. Once the ablutions were completed, Iemon sat down to tea, served as splendidly as any fantasy recorded in the pages of literature could have imagined it to be on the first day. Then the morning meal was brought in, again under the supervision of this woman whose expertise in the techniques of her craft was as accomplished as her features were hideous. And that was saying a lot. Iemon watched her move to and fro about the room with a mixture of curiosity, discomfort, and admiration. He was quick to note the agility with which she was able to conceal the slight limp that afflicted her as a result of a contraction of the muscles of one leg. The unevenness of her gait was nothing more than a slight blemish in the short, quick movements of a woman of surpassing grace. Art had triumphed over a diseased and gawkish frame.</p>
<p>Iwa left the room for a moment to gather flowers for the vases to be set on the Buddhist altar as an offering to the souls of the departed. She returned to find Iemon holding the memorial tablets in his hands. As a former monk, they had attracted his notice at once.</p>
<p>“Kangetsu Shinshi and Kangetsu Shinnyo. Iwa, these two people died on the same day of the same month—and in what year?”</p>
<p>“You can find it inscribed on the back of the tablet,” she replied. “And, no, it is not a case of double suicide.”</p>
<p>Having piqued his curiosity, she motioned him to sit down as she poured tea in preparation for what promised to be a long tale. As the story progressed, her voice and manner grew more strained and serious, but she never lifted her eyes from the tatami.</p>
<p>“The tablets are for my father and mother. My mother’s name was Mino. She was a daughter of the Tamiya family who engaged in disreputable relations with my father Densuke, one of the household servants. Densuke was a good man, but his status as a mere attendant angered my grandfather to the point that he drove the two of them out of the house. Deprived of his livelihood, my father took a position as a cook in the house of a great nobleman. While there, he was coerced into becoming the accomplice of a very wicked man. The man had murdered a money-lender and forced my father to dispose of the body or be killed for refusing. The body was wrapped in a cloth and my father carried it to his house. When he stepped out for a minute, my mother’s curiosity got the better of her and she untied the bundle. Her screams aroused the neighbors. As they poured into the house, my mother went into contractions and gave birth to me then and there. I came into the world at the same time a crime was exposed. </p>
<p>“My father, no doubt warned by the crowd, fled Edo. My mother only had enough time to tell her story to the coroner before she died. A year later to the day my father’s dead body was found floating in the castle moat, near the town of Yūki in Shimosa. He was taken for a beggar by the authorities and little was done to investigate the matter. For a long time the cause of his death and the perpetrator of the crime remained unknown. Then a manager was robbed in the Shiba Pass and his companion killed. The criminals were tracked down. They confessed and were put to death. The leader and the vilest of the lot also confessed to the murders of Jūsuke the money-lender and my father Densuke. When he met my father later in Yūki, he was afraid that his past crimes would catch up with him. In his twisted disregard for my father’s remorse and desire to clear up the whole affair, he dismissed ‘that Densuke’ as a superstitious, haunted fool. The man’s eventual execution took away any chance I had of avenging the deaths of my father and mother directly. But he left behind a son, Kichitarō. My one desire is to find him and exact revenge for the wickedness of his father Takahashi Daihachirō.”</p>
<p>At first Iemon followed her story halfheartedly. But as more and more details came to light, his attention to each step of the story grew more intense. He gave an abrupt start at the mention of the name of Takahashi Daihachirō. Yanagibara Kazuma, Tamiya Iemon—these were no more than aliases for that very same Kichitarō, the son of Takahashi Daihachirō, who had later taken the name Myōshin as a priest at the Jōshin-ji temple in the Reigan district of Fukagawa.</p>
<p>How strange the ways of fate to bring these two into the most intimate relationship of husband and wife. When Iemon had regained control over his voice, he spoke up. </p>
<p>“I understand why you should have such feelings towards a man as wicked as Daihachirō. But why such hatred toward Kichitarō? Surely the boy is not to be held responsible for his father’s sins.”</p>
<p>“That’s the way men reason,” answered Iwa. “Women, ignorant and foolish as they are, have only their feelings to consult. If it takes me seven rebirths, I will catch that wicked son of a wicked father, hold him fast in my hands, and gnaw on him. That is the vow I have taken against Kichitarō.”</p>
<p>She raised her head and Iemon turned away shivering. Before his very eyes she seemed to have aged into an old hag. The glossy face mottled with black marks like speckled pumice, the eyes lying like small dots sunk into a puffy bed, the gaping mouth with its large shining teeth—all turned this plain and gentle girl into a veritable demon. The certainty and intensity of her irremediable hatred drove deeply into Iemon. He was so unnerved that he even nodded in agreement with her last words. </p>
<p>“I may be revolting and perhaps you have found my story no less so,” added Iwa in a gentle voice, “but this is all between me and my enemy. I remain bound to you for two lifetimes. Kindly dispense with the formality. Call me Iwa and regard me with affection.”</p>
<p>Iemon promised to himself that he would do so and try to let the present make up for the past. But in the days that followed, Iwa overtook his sleep like a nightmare. He could feel the clamp of her teeth on his throat and would wake up gasping for air. In time, he adjusted to the situation and succeeded in lulling her into unquestioning admiration and trust where her husband was concerned. There seemed no chance of Iwa’s ever learning the truth, or of believing it if she did.</p>
<p>8 A Strange Reunion</p>
<p>Matazaemon’s illness was quite as Chōbei had predicted. In the weeks that followed it became clear that his last hold on life was rapidly weakening. During that time Iemon had earned a glowing reputation among the members of his household and his neighbors. They all recognized how good-looking he was. His heart was rotten to the core, but that was something he kept carefully concealed. His fear of Iwa motivated him to fortify his facade of kindness, which became easier as the days passed. Plain as she was of face and figure, no one could help but be attracted by Iwa’s good disposition. Given his peculiar circumstances, Iemon held out the hope that it would be to his advantage, even if he were to be discovered. Day by day he came to discount the possibility of that ever happening. His half-fond, half-repugnant feelings for Iwa were tinged with contempt for one so wrapped up in her immediate surroundings and so attentive to matters at hand. It was easy to deceive her and keep her in the dark.</p>
<p>One day Iemon was summoned to the old man’s bedside. He was shocked at the change that had taken place in a matter of just a few hours. Propped up on pillows, Matazaemon readied himself to speak his final words. With a shadow of his old officious smile and manner, he addressed Iemon. </p>
<p>“The Tamiya family is to be commended on its good fortune at the entrance of one so well qualified in appearance and comportment to uphold its reputation. My dear son-in-law, please accept my thanks. I have left everything in your hands—our possessions, our reputation, and our granddaughter.”</p>
<p>Iemon bowed low in acknowledgment and humility at the benevolence shown him. Matazaemon continued.</p>
<p>“There is one more matter and it is close to this old man’s heart. I appeal to your admirable sensitivities in making this one last request. Iwa is a plain girl. My end is near, but the gossip of our neighbors has reached my ears and opened my eyes to the truth. You have done us a great favor in overlooking her plainness and taking her to wife. Everything is in your hands, Iemon. Be considerate of her happiness and treat her well. If you can, avoid taking a concubine. But if you do seek such companionship, I beg you to keep it from Iwa. Plainness and jealousy go hand in hand. A temperament as faithful and upright as hers is not to be tested on that point. She would be most unhappy. Better the loose women of Shinjuku Naka-chō than one who would take your wife’s place. May you have the humility to remember this last request of Tamiya Matazaemon.”</p>
<p>He clasped Iemon’s hand and tears were in his eyes as he spoke. Iemon, too, was moved. It almost scared him to think of being left alone with Iwa.</p>
<p>“Perish the thought. Iwa’s sweet disposition is more than a match for great beauty. Who could think of letting any harm come to her? Perhaps there will be child in the picture, which should help dispel your gloomy thoughts. For now, concentrate on your will to live and look forward to a complete recovery to good health. That is what I pray for each day at the Myōgyō-ji temple.”</p>
<p>Matazaemon smiled faintly. Was it gratification or skepticism? Death seems to have a way of clearing one’s vision. Iemon did in fact make frequent appearances at the family temple as a representative of the master of the Tamiya family. But just as often did his feet turn him in the opposite direction to run the gauntlet of charms among the frail beauties of Naka-chō. Iemon held fast to Matazaemon’s hand, swearing his faithfulness resolutely and with the best of intentions. Suddenly he raised his head. The emotion aroused by their exchange was too much for the old man’s frail heart. His head slipped down sideways on the pillow. He had choked on the small stream of dark bitter vomit that flowed from his mouth. He was dead.</p>
<p>His wife and grandchild were grief-stricken. But Iemon—he had become a person of importance, the new master of the Tamiya family. Whatever he did about Chōbei’s advice to feed the old woman lizards, however many times she visited the homes of her neighbors to recite a litany of praises for her wonderful son in-law, however much the loss of her companion of so many years wore down her already feeble frame, before the maple leaves had turned red, Naka would follow her husband to the grave. Once again the halls of the Tamiya house echoed with the funereal chants of the Buddhist priest. The corpse was laid out to accommodate the guests and custodians who attended the wake. The seventh night of her death was duly observed, and with the withdrawal of the deceased spirit from the scene of its former life, Iemon was free to direct his attentions to the life that lay ahead. Outwardly nothing changed. He remained the same kind and affectionate husband as before. The neighbors, who had anticipated a change in his behavior, sung his praises all the louder. Then one day, two old acquaintances appeared at the door of the Tamiya house, Natsume Kyūzō and Imaizumi Jinzaemon.</p>
<p>“Iemon, we have come on a pressing matter. We are on our way to the ward chief, Itō Kaiho, and would ask you to join us. You are known to be an expert at go. He prides himself on his skill at the game and is feeling anxious about all the talk of an able rival whom he has not yet tested. There is to be a dinner and saké in the mix. We dare not present ourselves without you. Please accompany us. It would be advantageous even for you to get to know such a powerful and wealthy personality in the ward.”</p>
<p>Iemon laughed and agreed to join them. In no time he had dressed himself for the ceremonious first visit. The three of them stepped into their clogs and set out for the commander’s house near Samegabashi.</p>
<p>As much as Iemon had been impressed by the wealth of the Tamiya family, it paled in comparison with that of the head of Yotsuya Ward. Itō Kaiho was a man of sixty-four years but had retained much of the vigor of his youth. For the past ten years, he had added go to his twin passions for saké and women, neither of which seemed to have affected a keen vision to read the finest print in the faint light of a paper lantern, a sturdy set of teeth that could chew through hard and dried mochi rice as if it were as a soft bun, or an agility of movement that one would never suspect of such a substantial frame. At the mention of the name Tamiya, he looked up with great curiosity, which struck Iemon as rather rude. He greeted his host solemnly.</p>
<p>“I fear I have gone too long wihtout paying your lordship my proper respects, but I must extend my apologies for intruding unannounced.”</p>
<p>“Think nothing of it!” replied Kaiho, obviously taken in by his stately demeanor. “The fault is all mine for not having called on you. The fact is, the Tamiya and Kaiho families have been at odds these past many years and all visits have ceased. But that is of no concern to the younger generation. You are as fine a fellow as everyone has been telling me, Iemon. Goodness me, just the kind to turn all the girls’ hearts aflutter. You are the very image of myself in my younger years. It used to bother husbands just to have me around. The fairest among them were even themselves attracted. Oh well, they all had their turn with me and I never skipped a beat. I’m as good today as I ever was. In some ways, even…. But what have we now? A man like you has gone and married the—the lady of the Tamiya family.”</p>
<p>Iemon could tell that Kaiho had nearly let the term obake slip out. He knew how kind a person Iwa was and took the affront personally. It grated on him more than a little when he had to deal with such displays of bewilderment and sarcasm. Kaiho sensed that something was up and suavely intervened to call for a cushion and change the subject.</p>
<p>“You are reputed to be a go player. I myself am a mere amateur, so I should probably request a game and set the odds.… All right then, a board and stones if you would please!”</p>
<p>Kaiho and Iemon faced each other as opponents; Natsume and Imaizumi sat down at the sides of the board. Kaiho’s self-confidence was such that he readily accepted Iemon’s self-effacing offer at face value: the game was to be played at even odds. Iemon had actually acquired the sixth grade of expertise, several ranks higher than Kaiho. Naturally, as the game progressed, Kaiho found himself at a serious disadvantage. His brow began to knit tightly and Natsume was in a tither. They hadn’t even begun to eat and drink. If Iemon thought to curry favor with Kaiho by thrashing him at his favorite game the first time they played, the chances that they would get to do either were small. </p>
<p>Natsume deliberately let his tobacco pipe fall, and as he bent over to pick it up, gave Iemon a hard pinch on the backside. Iemon was too surprised to let out a sound. His quick wit scrambled for a reason for the unprovoked assault. Natsume was stone-faced and Imaizumi looked worried. But it was Kaiho’s expression that told it all: courtesy and dinner were on the line. Even Natsume and Imaizumi were overcome with admiration at what happened next. Iemon’s misstep was a stroke of genius, the kind of inspired move that only an accomplished player could pull off. The mistake was minor and easily slipped Kaiho’s notice, but it left Iemon’s game completely exposed and at the mercy of his opponent. Kaiho promptly jumped at the opportunity to regain the advantage. He glanced triumphantly at the others as Iemon struggled bravely to recover from the desperate position he had put himself in. Kaiho won this first game easily. The second he lost by a small margin. In the third he scored a resounding win to secure his superiority over a true expert. Confident at being undisputed champion of the ward, his mood was all geniality as he sorted out the black and white go stones and put them back into their lacquered boxes.</p>
<p>“Ah, Shingū go stones,” he sighed. “Soft as a woman’s hands. But never mind the fair sex. It’s time for fish and saké…. Hana can pour the saké for us.”</p>
<p>He turned to his servant, “Hey, how about some refreshment for our distinguished guests? Tell Hana to do the honors.”</p>
<p>Hana appeared with the saké. She was a beautiful girl of no more than twenty years. Her supple shoulders sloped down from a daintily placed head that was the center of attention and admiration. Her face was high-browed and perfectly oval like a melon—something we Japanese hold in high regard—and was framed in long and luxurious tresses, fastened below the waist and reaching nearly to her ankles. She was dressed for the summer heat in a light colored kimono of Akashi crepe and a broad, peach-colored sash interwoven with waves of thread into a delicate but indistinct design. The sleeves, drawn slightly back, revealed her arms well up to the shoulder. A glimpse of her beautifully moulded neck and bosom flashed from time to time as she moved to and fro about making preparations to serve the saké. The delicate fabric of her kimono seemed to caress the rather narrow hips of her girlish figure. Her every movement was studied and graceful. Hana had belonged to the Fukadaya household at Yagurashita in Fukagawa where she was a so-called sashed concubine, that is, one who wore a proper sash rather than the loose robe of common women.</p>
<p>“In the Tenpō era, all Fukagawa concubines were dressed like this.”</p>
<p>Old Kaiho had been captivated by her beauty and paid a ransom to make her his concubine. She has held that position in the house for nearly two years. Iemon was the first to be served. She stepped to the front and knelt before him, looking into his face as she handed him the tray with the saké cup. They both flinched at the same time and everyone took notice. Some of the saké spilled.</p>
<p>Kaiho asked, “Iemon, you know this woman then?”</p>
<p>His tone was curt and harsh as befitted the suspicions of a jealous old man. But Iemon’s former profession stood him in good stead. He was smooth-talking and made no attempt to deny what had just been made perfectly obvious. </p>
<p>“As a matter of fact I do, and I have nothing to be ashamed of. The situation was entirely out of my control. I used to be a fortune-teller and had set up shop on a public highway.”</p>
<p>“So I’ve heard,” grumbled Kaiho. “A soothsayer without customers, and with no use for a crystal ball but to char the rafters of the attic you called home.”</p>
<p>Iemon tried to avoid direct confrontation, but his response was firm and to the point. </p>
<p>“I would ask you not to make light of the serious problems that affect those suffering from poverty.… One day as I was sitting in my stall, I noticed a girl walking down the Kuramae. Staggering along nearby was a drunken samurai. From time to time he lurched in her direction, and at one point drew so close that, as she turned away, she caught her parasol in his cloak and tore it slightly. He flew into a rage, laying his hands on her in no mood for excuses.</p>
<p>“‘Careless wench! You have gone and torn my robe. How dare you! The only way I can forgive you is if you accompany me at once to the inn to serve me saké and satisfy me as I wish. You can count on it.’</p>
<p>“People gathered around them like a ring of black mountains until all one could see were heads. Hana felt humiliated as she struggled to free herself from the insults and advances of her drunken assailant. I stepped away from my stall to unveil the samurai hidden under my fortune-teller’s garb and interposed on the girl’s behalf. I apologized for what had happened and upbraided the drunkard for being so rude. Instead of calming down, he raised a fist and struck me in the face. Given his state of inebriation, I had no trouble taking him down without even using my arms. I locked my leg in his and promptly dispatched him into the ditch. Without a word to Hana, we both took to our heels, disappearing in different directions. Iemon the samurai reverted back to Iemon the soothsayer. As for my role in the whole affair, my only regret is that I had no weapon at hand to draw. Later on I met Hana at the Asakusa Kannon temple, where she thanked me for what was really a very trivial service.”</p>
<p>“And I thank you again,” spoke the beautiful women as he lifted up her downcast face to look directly into Iemon’s eyes. </p>
<p>“So that’s the story is it?” remarked Kaiho. “A fortunate encounter and a strange reunion. The world is full of that sort of thing. It is only right, Hana, that you now have the chance to repay your rescuer with something more valuable than words. Please, pour him some saké.”</p>
<p>At the time, Kaiho took it all in as a man of the world. But he was no fool, “this old badger with a thousand autumns of experience on hill and dale.” He knew only too well that there was a closer bond between Iemon and Hana than that accidental encounter.</p>
<p>9 Love Knots</p>
<p>Iemon was to pay many visits to the home of Itō Kaiho for games of go. Meanwhile, the love affair between the young man and young woman progressed rapidly, consuming them in the fires of passion. Earlier—some two years or more previously, when Iemon was still a monk at the Jōshin-ji temple of the Reigan district of Fukagawa and was spending the money of the chief priest so freely—he had met Hana at the Fukagawa of Yagurashita. She was new to the profession, but she captivated him from the start and inspired him with emotions that did not dim with time. It was in her company that the temple funds of the temple had been squandered to the winds. His feelings were shared by Hana. His one goal was to ransom the lady and then live together as husband and wife. This was the plot they agreed on. But the sum demanded for her release was larger than expected. Iemon—or Kazuma, the name he took outside the temple walls—had already planned a larger raid than usual on the temple treasury when he was warned by Hana that his scheme had been discovered. He sought safety in flight, but not before a last tearful parting with his lover and a promise that somehow fate would bring them back together. His new position made it possible for Iemon to fulfill that promise and bring it to full bloom.</p>
<p>In his pursuit of Hana, who was a coy and willing accomplice, the young lover was circumspect and vigilant. Or at least he thought he was. In fact, their close friends were soon appraised of the situation, with the exception, that is, of the two parties most affected: Iwa and Kaiho. Iwa took the ensuing spousal neglect as one might expect a wife to, putting it down to some passing dalliance in Shinjuku Naka-chō. She did not take it to heart as she would have if she had known that a concubine was involved. For his part, Kaiho, the usually astute and nosy old man, was so immersed in playing go that he grew blind, deaf, and dumb to everything else. When the affair reached the ears of Kondō Rokurobei, honorable old gentleman that he was, he became seriously alarmed. If true, he would be put in the impossible situation of trying to reconcile Iemon, master of the Tamiya family, Iwa, his ward, and Itō Kaiho, a powerful influence in all their daily lives.</p>
<p>That night there was to be a meeting at Kaiho’s house: a competition in dramatic recitation, dancing, and poetry. Kondō timed a visit to the Tamiya household accordingly.</p>
<p>“Greetings, Iwa. Will Iemon be joining us tonight at the leader’s house? I have come from Kawagoe and was thinking that perhaps it is not too late to seek company on the way.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my! It’s you. I am afraid the master has only just begun making preparations…. Iemon! The master of Yotsuyazaka has come seeking company en route to Master Itō’s.… But please, come in. Iemon will be ready shortly.”</p>
<p>Kondō looked at her quizzically. She showed no sign of distress or misgivings. He felt encouraged. Perhaps the rumors were false or exaggerated. Or maybe it was all a bit of mischief cooked up by Akiyama Chōzaemon who had told him of it that very day.</p>
<p>Kondō turned to greet Iemon, who was now ready to go. As they reached the entrance, Iemon spoke to his wife. </p>
<p>“This is going to be a long, drawn-out affair. Feel free to turn in early and not await my return.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” countered Iwa. “The sound of your footsteps will awaken me to let you in.” </p>
<p>Iemon laughed.</p>
<p>“And how’s that? Are my footsteps so different from those of Akiyama or other frequent visitors?”</p>
<p>Iwa was serious. “When a wife can no longer tell the footsteps of her husband, that means she no longer cares for him. I will be ready to receive you no matter what the hour.”</p>
<p>“And it’s sure to be late,” added Kondō. “The party will be made up mainly of young men. Afterwards they will head off to Naka-chō. Would it be all right if Iemon went along?” </p>
<p>Iwa winced visibly.</p>
<p>“The master is always the master, inside the home and out. He may do as he pleases.”</p>
<p>“Delicately spoken, like a true wife. It is so rare to meet such a couple. It’s as if a painted duck and drake had flown off a folding screen and landed here in Yotsuya. I am proud to be your guardian.”</p>
<p>As he and Iemon made their way through Tera-machi, Kondō broke the silence.</p>
<p>“You are a wonderful man indeed, handsome and pursued by the ladies. Iwa is undeniably ugly, yet you never fail to show her respect and consideration, in private as well as in public. Nothing in one’s life is hidden from the neighbors in Yotsuya, but they speak well of you.”</p>
<p>The younger man replied matter-of-factly, “How could anyone fail Iwa? She is amiability itself. Plain, perhaps, but her gentleness more than makes up for it. It is a greater treasure for our household than mere beauty could ever be.”</p>
<p>“Well spoken! You should keep that in mind because tongues are beginning to wag about you and Hana. Bad feelings can bring as much unhappiness as downright malice. And remember, Kaiho is not someone to trifle with.”</p>
<p>Iemon was a little put out at the directness of Kondō’s words.</p>
<p>“I can assure you there is nothing to such talk. A modest service rendered in the past only makes her more cordial to me than she is to ordinary strangers. Perhaps it has been excessive and should be discouraged. But Master Itō is good company and has good saké. Besides, he is a very good go player. It would be a shame to have to avoid him.”</p>
<p>Kondō was annoyed and it showed up in his sharp rebuke to the maid on arrival at Kaiho’s house. </p>
<p>“How badly you receive the middle-aged man accompanying this young fellow! Is this the master’s doing? Tamiya is not the only one in clogs. Am I just to shift for myself?”</p>
<p>The girl was flustered and apologized profusely as she hastened to correct the oversight. Kondō was calmer now.</p>
<p>“No wonder,” he mumbled, “Bring Tamiya near a woman and everything falls apart…. And Master Itō?”</p>
<p>“This way, good sirs. The master awaits his guests.”</p>
<p>They entered the sitting room to find Kaiho angry and sulking. For some reason—perhaps a mistake in the message, or the wrong date, or ambiguous language—not a one of the invited guests had appeared.</p>
<p>“The supper we prepared is all a waste. The four of us would hardly even make a dent in it. Not so for the saké. Let us all do double duty there.”</p>
<p>He scurried about and called out his orders excitedly, eager to be most cordial with the guests who had not failed him. Iemon noted the presence of a certain Kihei. He was curious, never having seem him there before, and wondered what effect he would have on Hana’s position in the household. Physically, there was no cause for concern. Kihei was exceedingly unattractive with a face like a theater mask, and he knew that Hana was a woman who paid great attention to outward appearances, not to mention physical strength and vigor.</p>
<p>Kihei was one of the younger sons of Inagaki Shōgen, a shogunate vassal with his own residence in Honjo and an annual income of three thousand bags of rice. It seemed almost certain that Kaiho would adopt Kihei into his family. The negotiations had been going on for some time, but there seemed to be some hitch that Iemon could not figure out. What did not escape his attention was Kihei’s hostility toward him. He also happened to be a respected swordsman who somehow made a living teaching the art. He was the last man Iemon had any desire to quarrel with. Iemon was a coward, and Kihei’s cold stare sent a chill down his spine. He made a point to be extremely polite when engaging him in conversation.</p>
<p>The party was small, but everyone did their best to make up for the missing guests by livening things up. Kihei performed a dance, people took turns substituting for the no-shows when the saké was served, and there was even a poetry competition. After handing in his submission—by no means an unimpressive one—Iemon left the room for a moment. As he stepped out into the hallway and was about to return to the guest room, he found the maid Moto awaiting him with water and a towel. A tight frown came over Iemon’s face at the indiscretion. The girl pleaded with him, “Master, please be patient. My lady is at her wit’s end. The failure of the other guests to show up, the pursuit of Master Kihei who is trying to compromise her and get her expelled from the household, and even the possibility of dying at the hand of Master Kaiho has driven her well nigh mad. A moment—in this room.”</p>
<p>Iemon drew back. “A separate room, and in darkness! Boys and girls older than seven were never to be allowed alone together.”</p>
<p>He would have refused, but one push from behind and he was within. The sliding doors closed behind him.</p>
<p>Kaiho’s voice called out loudly, “Hana! Hana! What has become of the girl? There is no one to serve the saké. If Kihei’s unsightliness has driven her to take cover, at least Tamiya’s handsomeness should lure her out. Hana, Hana!”</p>
<p>Hana slipped away hastily from Iemon’s arms. Passing through the garden she entered the kitchen and snatched up a carafe of saké from the stove, not noticing that the fire had gone out. She and Iemon entered the sitting room from different sides. Kondō looked sharply at Iemon. Kihei was engaged in spirited conversation with Kaiho.</p>
<p>“Where have you been?¨ asked Kondō. “If nature was calling, what took you so long? What would rice powder be doing there? Surely plaster would not leave a cheek mark on your sleeve.”</p>
<p>He laid a cautionary hand on Iemon, skillfully rubbing away the telltale mark in the process. </p>
<p>“It’s obvious what was going on. Fortunately for you, Kaiho and Kihei have been squabbling over the qualities of the master swordsmen Heinai and Shōsetsu, both of whom are as dead as the feud between the Toyotomi and the Tokugawa. Heinai was loyal and Shōsetsu a traitor, but Kihei has been trying the patience of the old officer by applauding Shōsetsu’s superior prowess. The saké had gotten cold and that put Kaiho in a such foul mood that he could hardly think straight. Flatter Kihei by taking his side, if you will, but don’t get into a quarrel with him. He is an expert with a sword and has a temper as ugly as his face. He would be only too happy to take you on. Besides, he doesn’t like you….”</p>
<p>Kondō stopped talking. Kaiho had just picked up the fresh bottle of saké and was livid.</p>
<p>“Cold as stone! How careless of you.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be,” said Hana in surprise. “It’s fresh off the stove.”</p>
<p>Kaiho put the bottle in her hand and looked confused.</p>
<p>“You must have been asleep, or else too preoccupied to notice.”</p>
<p>For the first time he looked sharply at her, then at Iemon. But he had often given Hana a great deal of leeway in her dealings with him.</p>
<p>“Asleep! Just so, and little wonder. With all the absent guests, this evening has been a catastrophe. If Tamiya had brought his wife with him, the disaster would have been complete.”</p>
<p>Kaiho, Kihei, and Kondō smiled at the sally. Iemon took the cue and voiced his resentment frostily. </p>
<p>“I’ll have you know, Iwa brings life to everything she touches and is a woman of uncommon intelligence.”</p>
<p>Hana looked at him and then smiled lightly, reassured. As she passed behind him she stumbled and whispered. </p>
<p>“I almost forgot.”</p>
<p>Iemon felt a letter thrust into his hand, which he quickly slipped into his sleeve. Then he and Kondō rose to take their leave, accompanied by the customary farewells. As if to compensate for the way things had gone, everyone saw them off together. Kaiho was still grumbling and half bickering with Hana. Moto was engaged with Kondō. Kihei insisted on helping Iemon on with his cloak and Iemon did not dare to refuse his services. As Kihei tried to adjust his clumsiness with one arm, he made a mess of it on the other. Neither of them was too steady on his feet. Kondō and Iemon set out in the rain. “Sayonara, sayonara!”</p>
<p>10 The Plot Against Iwa</p>
<p>The following morning Iemon sat brooding, his mind and speech numbed by the previous night’s drinking. Iwa busied herself quietly with his recovery. When Rokurobei delivered him to her, decidedly the worse for wear, he had to admit he was rather surprised at the young man’s inability to hold his saké. (Middle-age Japanese typically have a seasoned level of tolerance when it comes to drink.) Thinking it partly her own fault but taking comfort in Kondō’s account of the events of the evening, Iwa methodically warmed up some saké and served it to them. As she did so, she chatted away about the careless gossip going around the neighborhood, including recent stories about Itō Kaiho’s adoption of an heir. </p>
<p>“This fellow Kihei’s disposition seems to be as ugly as his face.”</p>
<p>With a little smile she added, “He doesn’t seem to realize that the former is his only way to compensate for the latter. What’s to become of Hana?”</p>
<p>For the first time since the night before, the thought of the letter flashed through Iemon’s mind. He set down the restorative drink and excused himself from the room. His clothes lay neatly folded in a lacquered tray. He hastily searched the sleeves, but there was no sign of it. His face was clouded as he returned to the sitting room. He glanced at Iwa and felt ashamed. It had never come into her hands. He knew her well enough to realize that had she found it, it would have been laid together meticulously with his tobacco pouch, tissue paper, and other items for daily use. Perhaps the whole thing was a dream. The more he thought about it, the more he was convinced that it must be so. His meeting with Hana, their being caught by surprise at Kondō’s rebuke—that much from the evening was fairly clear. But when it came to the final round of drinks, getting up to leave, and standing in the cold night air, the precise course of events became foggy.</p>
<p>“Yes, it was all an hallucination. Hana never would have been so foolhardy.”</p>
<p>Still, a trace of doubt remained. He would clear it up at the source: at Kaiho’s house and from Hana’s own lips.</p>
<p>Kaiho greeted him with almost boisterous cheer.</p>
<p>“Ah! You come early, a glowing tribute to last night’s reception.”</p>
<p>Iemon offered a self-deprecating response by way of apology. “Don’t talk nonsense like a common country peasant. You are a man of the world and should give me credit for being the same. What’s it all about anyway? A little too much saké…. Hana, Hana! The master of the Tamiya family has come. Bring some tea and bean paste sweets. And heat the saké. Matazaemon was such a sober old dog that I doubt Iwa learned anything about the best remedy for a hangover.”</p>
<p>Kaiho turned to Kihei who had just entered the room. </p>
<p>“Here is the inventory for the Shimosa farms. Have a look at the headman’s report. Hana will assist you.”</p>
<p>He dismissed them and turned to Iemon. </p>
<p>“How about a swig? No? Then I will drink for both of us. This is a happy day for me and you showed up at just the right time. I was planning to send for you to seek your counsel. The matter of Kihei’s adoption has finally been settled.”</p>
<p>The old man’s exuberance hammered away at Iemon’s already pounding headache, but he feigned interest as best he could. </p>
<p>“I see! Kihei is to be congratulated. To hear that everything has turned out to your satisfaction as head of the ward, I can only express my delight and offer you my best wishes.”</p>
<p>“No, I need a little more than that from you, Iemon. There is another matter of some importance. I am getting old. I am no longer trying to find a woman to give me a child of my own, but the truth is, if Hana should give birth to a child, it would be most inconvenient. What should I do if that happens?”</p>
<p>He was now looking directly into Iemon’s eyes. Befuddled, Iemon stammered. </p>
<p>“Unquestionably. Yes. Hana could become a real embarrassment. And that would be a real problem for Kihei as well. She….”</p>
<p>Kaiho smiled contemptuously.</p>
<p>“You are wise beyond your years, Iemon. You grasped the situation immediately. Take Hana for yourself.”</p>
<p>Kaiho raised his voice slightly, signalling Kihei to bring in Hana from the next room. She looked alarmed and shamefaced. </p>
<p>“What have you there?” asked Kaiho. “The inventory? Aha, a letter! And who better to read it than Iemon. Please do us the honors. No one can give its contents the proper inflection like you.”</p>
<p>He handed it over to Iemon. At a glance he realized that it was a letter from Hana, probably the one she had passed him the previous night. Kihei must have picked his pocket. There was no denying it; the whole thing was a trap. The party had been a plot to trick Hana into revealing her feelings. Even the old fool Kondō had been invited as an unwitting witness. Iemon caught a glimpse of the young maid Moto passing by in the hallway with a mocking smirk on her face.</p>
<p>Kaiho did not interrupt the silence, which was becoming increasingly oppressive, apparently anticipating an incriminating outburst from Hana, who by now was plainly on the verge of tears. But she got hold of herself and cast a calm, inquisitive gaze in the direction of the three men. Only Iemon looked down, his eyes fixed on the letter whose characters seemed to dance and flutter on the page. Instead of his usual astute self, Iemon was overcome with cowardice, unnerved by this vigorous, sly old man backed up by a grinning and ill-mannered ruffian of a prospective son. He felt his body go numb. Kaiho leaned over and snatched the letter from his hands. </p>
<p>“Since you will not read the letter, I will have a go, though admittedly I am a poor substitute for an accomplished man of the cloth.”</p>
<p>The old fellow seemed to know everything and his tone of contempt confirmed as much. He unrolled the scroll in his hands.</p>
<p>“Well, well, what have we here! Something from a woman, and a lusty harlot at that…! I owe you an apology, Kihei, for having laughed off your suspicions.”</p>
<p>He threw the scroll down, furious. Kihei picked it up and began to read:</p>
<p>Night brings its pleasure, but how much greater the pleasure at seeing you. The day will comes when you and I, Iemon and Hana, will be husband and wife, in fact if not in form. To be day and night at your service—that is my prayer to all the gods and buddhas. When I am away from you, even for a short while, the passage of time is painful. Hold this letter tightly against your breast. I anxiously await the arrival of night that will bring you to me. Your relationship with Iwa is punishment for sins committed in an earlier life. That is all there is to it; for the rest, dismiss her from your mind. This ill-natured brush has ceased to obey me. Woe is me and heavy my lot to bear! Only when you come to me shall my heart’s desire be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>To Iemon	from Hana</p>
<p>Kaiho’s blood boiled as he listened. At the mention of Iemon’s name he sprang up and made a movement toward the stand holding his swords. Gripping the larger of the two, he turned with a scowl. </p>
<p>“Listen, you, I may be up in years but I have the vigor of youth. It’s for me to sport with women; I will not be made a fool of by them.”</p>
<p>Kihei stepped in immediately. </p>
<p>“Do you think taking your revenge this way will bring you satisfaction? It seems a poor choice to me. The matter can be settled easily without becoming a scandal in the ward. Please, give it some thought. Punishing the two with death here and now may be the honorable thing to do, but is it the best course of action? Hear me out, if you would.”</p>
<p>Kaiho pulled himself up, almost as if someone had dragged him back. His rage subsided and gave way to a cold-blooded spite. He smiled blandly.</p>
<p>“There’s no use quarreling over a harlot. I will spare their lives. Iemon will take Hana home—as his wife.”</p>
<p>“As my wife!” Iemon’s shock broke through his fear. “Surely your grace is being unreasonable. I am only the adopted son of the Tamiya family. Asking me to dismiss Iwa is going too far. We have declared our love to each other, I admit, but that is as far as it has gone. We have had absolutely no intimate relations, before or now.”</p>
<p>“Enough of your lies!” Kaiho retorted icily. “Besides, we were only talking about last night. But even that is not the point. I have a longstanding grudge against Matazaemon that remains unresolved. We will use Iwa to settle the score and you will not suffer the consequences. On the contrary, I will come to your aid. You, too, will help, Kihei…. Good, thanks for agreeing.</p>
<p>“Well, then, I shall have my sweet revenge. Hana the hussy will take the place of the honorable daughter of the Tamiya, who actually loves you! Let Natsume and Imaizumi nibble around the edges of the omelet; Iemon shall feast on the main course. Surely you do not object to the idea of driving Iwa out—honey for garlic, a flower for an ugly toad?</p>
<p>“Splendid! But now how shall we carry this off? Aha, it’s Kondō. Just in the nick of time. We need your experience and influence to get through to Iemon who insists on clinging to the obake.”</p>
<p>After being apprized of the situation, Kondō was aghast. The course of events was forcing him to part ways with Iemon and there seemed no escape. His first reaction was to turn on Iemon in bitter recrimination.</p>
<p>“My, my, what a virtuous fellow you are! You drink a man’s saké, sleep with his woman, and then preach morality to his household. Well, it’s over now. The damage is done. Even if you’re not Hana’s lover, everybody believes you are….”</p>
<p>Kaiho raised his fists in a calculated display of wrath. Kihei and Kondō stepped in to calm things down. Iemon’s last line of resistance was broken. Talk—that’s what monk’s do, after all. In no time he was as eagerly engaged in the plot as if he had left the house in Samon-chō earlier to hatch it.</p>
<p>“How difficult can it be?” asked Kondō. “We get Watanabe Gorō to seduce Iwa and make love with her. He is deeply in debt but also handsome enough to arouse suspicions among everyone in the ward. Iemon could catch them in the act and expose Iwa’s adultery. Things can stop there for her. After all, she’s an innocent party in all of this. There’s no excuse for abusing her husband’s rights, but neither she nor Watanabe deserve to be harmed.”</p>
<p>Kihei laughed outright at the thought of Iemon standing over the adulterers with a sword in his hand. Iemon redirected his contempt to Kondō with a sneer. </p>
<p>“The plan is worthless. Iwa is the soul of chastity. When I am away, no man is even allowed to enter our home.” </p>
<p>Kaiho furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“Kakusuke, get in here.” </p>
<p>As the attendant entered, Kaiho gave him his orders.</p>
<p>“Go over to the house of Akiyama Chōzaemon and tell him that the head of the ward wishes to speak with him.” </p>
<p>Kakusuke turned to leave at once. </p>
<p>“Chōzaemon is the right man. He’s a regular old woman when it comes to gossip and spite. Be happy and he weeps; weep and he’s happy. If Akiyama can’t concoct a plan to get rid of Iwa, no one can…. Otherwise, Hana and Iemon would have to die at my hand, and Kihei is here to help me see to it.”</p>
<p>Kihei and the old man were overjoyed at Iemon’s display of cowardice and Hana’s fear. But not for long. Akiyama Chōzaemon, the one-time boyhood suitor of Iwa, a tall, lean, hungry-looking man, with a long, ashen face and one bad eye, arrived with an attendant. Nakusuke was close behind, like a policeman escorting a none too willing captive. Chōzaemon felt relieved on seeing the gathering that it was not about the money he owed Kaiho. The old man dismissed the attendant and proceeded to lay out the situation. Chōzaemon was quick to agree.</p>
<p>“All right, then! Tamiya will take Master Itō’s cast-off lover. Kihei for Hana. That’s seems fair enough, no one getting swindled. But Iemon, you need to go into this with eyes wide open. One hears you are already intimately acquainted with the woman.”</p>
<p>This was Chōzaemon’s way of approaching things. He did not let Kihei’s scowling or Kaiho’s fuming bother him. They needed him or they would not have asked for his advice. Iemon, for his part, was grateful to Chōzaemon both for his friendship and for the insult to Kihei and Kaiho. The mediator continued.</p>
<p>“The obstacle, of course, is the obake. Iwa needs to be driven out of the house. What if Watanabe doesn’t succeed? No need to worry on that score. Who ever heard of chastity in an obake! And besides, everyone knows that women seduce men. You are now head of the Tamiya family, Iemon, and that means that once Iwa is out of the way, its property all falls your way. She must be forced to leave of her own will. Good, very good. And what is all this worth to Master Kaiho?”</p>
<p>“Look to Iemon for your commission,” Kaiho snapped.</p>
<p>“No, no!” replied Chōzaemon. “Kaiho is Kaiho and Iemon is Iemon. I will deal with each of you separately. If you had taken matters into you own hands at the start and undertaken extreme measures, that would have been the end of it. But we talked things out and to reverse course now is out of the question. You wish to adopt Kihei and get rid of Hana. That leaves Iemon caught in the middle with no choice but to go along. Hana is a woman, so she has no voice in the matter. That much is clear. What remains to be taken care of is compensation for my own role in the whole affair.”</p>
<p>He gave Kihei a sour look of reprimand and then shifted a demanding gaze from Kaiho to Iemon, and from Iemon to Kaiho. Iemon was only too happy to nod his approval. Chōzaemon promptly turned his back and faced Kaiho. At first the old man was infuriated at Chōzaemon for being so forward; his curt and unceremonious manner displeased him. It struck him that he could reply in kind, but his temper cooled.</p>
<p>“The ten ryō I lent you at the New Year—I will consider it paid, principal and interest, Kaiho grumbled. “That is your fee for a successful outcome.” </p>
<p>Chōzaemon threw up his hands in a semblance of shock.</p>
<p>“Cancelling the debt on money I borrowed! You expect me to go along with this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have to expect anything,” Kaiho promptly corrected him. “I have your seal, so one way or the other I am assured of payment.” Chōzaemon turned pensive.</p>
<p>“What you say is true. The last loan I took was guaranteed with my seal. Too bad…. Well, the terms are hard, but it seems I must give in. So the debt will be forgiven?”</p>
<p>“With Kihei and Iemon as your witnesses,” replied Kaiho.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” asked Chōzaemon.</p>
<p>The three of them put their heads together and Chōzaemon laid out the details. Kaiho pushed back his cushion and slapped his thighs.</p>
<p>“Chōzaemon, you’d be a bargain at twice the price. Just what we needed, eh, Iemon? And how about you, my new son-in-law?” </p>
<p>They all grinned broadly and endorsed the solution enthusiastically.</p>
<p>11 The Plot Unfolds</p>
<p>For two days Iemon kept running the preliminary steps through his mind. He seemed unwell and out of sorts. The third day he did not get up at all. Iwa was rightly worried as she spoke to him. </p>
<p>“The change of seasons can make one ill. Please take some medicine and let me call Doctor Suian.” </p>
<p>Iemon moaned disapprovingly, which only made her insist all the more.</p>
<p>“He is a prince of a doctor. Look here, a salve he recommended for the skin and nerves. Hana, Itō’s beautiful concubine, won’t use anything else. He quotes her in his guarantee that it will remove all kinds of blemishes no matter where they come from.”</p>
<p>Iemon looked up with a start. He found the association of images in his mind puzzling and worrisome. Perhaps it was the puffiness in Iwa’s face, but he couldn’t help recalling the repulsion he felt during marital relations. Women should leave men to play their own games, he thought to himself. </p>
<p>“Suian, that dealer in cosmetics and charms! You’d do well to steer clear of his plasters and potions. They’re all fake—or worse. You’re as black as a farm hand from Ryūkyū and Hana is fair as a white chrysanthemum. Do you really think the lotions of Doctor Suian could change black to white?”</p>
<p>His words startled Iwa. She turned her gaze away from the mirror, bewildered. Iemon had always been so considerate in speaking of personal matters with her. She had secretly been taking the doctor’s medicine for some weeks. In childhood she had exhibited certain tendencies to epilepsy. This had worn off with time, but of late they were beginning to reappear and this worried her. For now at least, Suian’s remedy was having a calming effect and holding off the warning signs of an attack.</p>
<p>Iemon barely gave her time to process the insult before going on.</p>
<p>“It’s probably just a cold. Some eggs and plenty of hot saké should take care of the symptoms. Please see to it for me.”</p>
<p>Iwa’s thoughts made an about-face. Suddenly she was the housekeeper and nurse again, eager to do what she could to make him comfortable. As Iemon was eating, Natsume Kyūzō and Imaizumi Jinzaemon entered.</p>
<p>“Iemon, pardon the intrusion. I suppose you already forgot about your meeting yesterday with Kaiho…. In bed with a cold, are we? There’s no good cure for that, but a lively, cheerful atmosphere helps….Aha, I see a dice box! You can thrown the dice as well lying down as sitting up. Let us help refresh your spirits with a game and some saké.”</p>
<p>Iemon took charge of the preparations. At first surprised, but then with some misgivings, Iwa heated bottle after bottle of saké. The men were too absorbed in their game to pay her the slightest attention. Ever so often they would bark out a demand for more saké to whomever was within earshot. When they had finished, Natsume was in high spirits as he rose to leave; Imaizumi and Iemon were correspondingly gloomy. This was only the first of many such encounters. They came together to play ever day over the next half month. On one occasion, long after he had recovered, Iemon stood with his hands tucked into the folds of his sash, looking sober and very bitter.</p>
<p>“Iwa, do we have any money in the house?” She looked at him in shock.</p>
<p>“Things have not been going well with Kyūzō and Jinzaemon. I am a hundred ryō down. If there is some spare cash around, I could try to repair the damage.”</p>
<p>Iwa prostrated herself before him. </p>
<p>“Husband, please reconsider. Spending your time gambling seems especially ill suited to an official of your rank. It is risky business and once discovered, rarely forgiven. Pardon me, but you really should listen to what I am saying.” </p>
<p>She paused anxiously as Iemon stared at her incensed and astonished.</p>
<p>“What! Are you thinking of arguing with your husband? Your insolence only adds to the insult of refusing my request. The very sight of you is enough to make one sick to one’s stomach. They stop ruffians and obake at the Hakone gate. But you—the guards must have been sleeping for you to slip through. Shut up! Get the money, or else….”</p>
<p>Iwa crouched near the sliding doors, terrified and caught off guard by his words. His abuse cut her deeply. Without warning she felt the sharp sting of a hand slapping against her cheek. She left the room without a word. When she returned, she held out a tray with thirty ryō in gold. She knelt down and presented it to Iemon timidly.</p>
<p>“Please forgive me; I know I am ugly and incompetent. But did you not take me as I am?” He stuffed the gold in his sash.</p>
<p>“No,” Iemon replied. “Kondō and Chōbei deceived me. A plain woman, perhaps. But never did I dream of a monster more disgusting than a pop-eyed demon. To offset the affront, I happen to like gambling. And gamble I shall. Just see to it that I have the necessary funds and don’t interfere.” </p>
<p>He shoved her roughly aside and left the house.</p>
<p>For some time Iwa saw nothing more of Iemon, though he did send word from time to time. In fact, he was living in semi-secrecy at Rokurobei’s house, from where he would send one or the other messenger to communicate with Iwa.</p>
<p>“If there’s no money—sell something. The messenger will tell you what to get rid of. My funds must be replenished.”</p>
<p>And so it was that one thing after another was taken from the house and brought to Kondō Rokurobei’s storehouse. It was he who had devised this clever ruse to strip Iwa of all her possessions. Along with her goods and clothes went the servants. In a matter of a few weeks Iwa was living in a three-mat room, nothing like the twelve-mat room she was used to. A brazier, a night lamp, and the clothes on her back were all that was left her in the house. Then, at long last, she saw him. The light had just dawned on a cold and snowy morning in early March. Iwa arose, opened the rain shutters, and began her day. Around nine o’clock, the sliding doors parted and in walked Iemon. He looked fresh off a night of debauchery. His garments were dirty and disheveled. His face was sallow, his eyes deep-set and weary, his manner listless. Iwa gave him the only cushion in the room.</p>
<p>He sat quietly before the brazier. Finally he spoke.</p>
<p>“A million pardons. My luck has been very bad…. Good heavens! The place looks a mess. It’s not fit for a man to live in.” </p>
<p>He looked around as if he had just woke up from a dream. </p>
<p>“It’s no wonder, I know. But everything will return to the way it was. Do I surprise you?”</p>
<p>“Things are a bit at odds and ends now,” Iwa replied meekly. “Myself, I don’t need much more than a radish and a handful of wheat. Does my lord intend to remain here? If so….” </p>
<p>There was a pained stammer to her voice and a confused look on her face. She had only one bu, a mere quarter of a ryō, in cash. The truth is, she was hoping for the farmer Yosuke to pay his monthly visit—that is, if there even was a farm any more. She had no way of knowing.</p>
<p>“Just for the night,” answered Iemon. “Food and rest are essential if I am to play well. I lost everything in the gambling dens of Shinjuku and Shinagawa in Naka-chō. Is there no money left in the house?… Evidently not. Please get hold of some, I don’t care how you do it.” </p>
<p>He took the silver coin she offered him.</p>
<p>“And I could do with a bath and some tobacco. See to it that a meal is ready for me when I return. Not much, some raw fish and saké will do. I would rather play than eat.” With that, he stood up.</p>
<p>Iwa heard the sound of the gate close behind him. She sat there for some time, her face buried in her knees. The situation was desperate. What was she to do? She looked around. There was nothing left to sell, not even herself. Who would buy someone as ugly as me? Suddenly a thought struck her, and she ran out the door and down the street. Before long she was standing at the door of her uncle, Yoemon. Iwa herself had had little to do with her aunt and uncle. Matazaemon had almost come to blows with his brother, whom he accused of being a despicable miser for amassing wealth through questionable means and dishonoring his position as a samurai. Chōbei had formerly been employed by Yoemon as an agent. In the end, Chōbei escaped justice but Yoemon was forced to leave Yotsuya and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The aunt came out in response to Iwa’s call and greeted her niece with surprise.</p>
<p>“Well, well, look at this stranger who has shown up at our door! We hear that the son-in-law the Tamiya family took in turned out to be a fine fellow.” </p>
<p>The old woman looked at Iwa shrewdly but not without kindness. Iwa took heart and replied.</p>
<p>“It’s true, things have not been going well of late. I’ve come to ask if you would lend me a small amount of rice and a bu to buy some eels or raw fish. I don’t mean to be presumptuous, but….”</p>
<p>“But presumptuous you are!” echoed a harsh voice near by. </p>
<p>Iwa shrank to the outer edge of the doorway; her aunt ran to the back of the house. Yoemon grimaced. </p>
<p>“And what are you doing here? As far as I know, your house has nothing to do with ours. I did not so much as a exchange word with my brother Matazaemon or give him a second glance, and I have no intention of doing so with his offspring. The Tamiya of Samon-chō can look out for themselves. No one sought my aid or advice in taking a son-in-law. You ended up with an outsider, a wayside fortune-teller, and this fine fellow turns out to be a gambler and profligate who has brought ruin to his household. You can look after him if you want, ignorant and foolish woman that you are. I’d rather help a needy beggar than let you have a single mon of my money.”</p>
<p>The grating rattled sharply as the angry old man pushed the gate outwards until the bar dropped. Iwa’s eyes were filled with pain and shock as she peered into the dark interior of the house. She had been such a recluse that she wasn’t aware of Iemon having become the talk of the ward. She turned and slowly made her way back to Samon-chō. She could no longer contain herself. She felt an uncontrollable urge to laugh and weep at the same time. Overwhelmed by her feelings, she ran to the closet and took out the potion Suian had prepared for her. Perhaps she had waited too long, but the medication had the opposite effect of what she expected. For an hour Iwa writhed in agony, screaming at one moment and bellowing with laughter the next. At last she sank into a slumber. </p>
<p>When she awoke, the sun was already well past its noonday peak. She jumped up in alarm. There was a meal to prepare—as is a wife’s duty—and she had not even begun. There was nothing else she could do, so she threw a towel about her uncombed hair and set out for the home of a certain Kuraya Jihei in Asakusa Kuramae. The man was a rice broker who also made loans against promissory notes for the rice pensions due the samurai.</p>
<p>The journey took her some distance away and Iwa was exhausted by the time she arrived. The shop boy at the entrance waved her off brusquely.</p>
<p>“Away with you, old girl. There’s nothing for you here. Please come back the day before yesterday.” </p>
<p>He blocked her way. Iwa took a step back before replying.</p>
<p>“I’m not asking for anything from this honorable house. I only wish to speak with Jihei.” </p>
<p>It was certainly not out of pity, but there was something about her tone or manner that made the lad hesitate.</p>
<p>“Jihei! There’s a beggar woman here who wants to speak with you. What shall I tell her?”</p>
<p>“There is nothing to talk about,” came the answer from within. “Tell her to read what’s written on the white sign hanging at entrance. That’s all we have to offer.” </p>
<p>As he spoke, he poked his head around the edge of the wall. Iwa lifted the towel from her face. At once he was on his feet.</p>
<p>“It has been some time since I have seen the honorable lady of Tamiya. I had many profitable dealings with Master Matazaemon. Please excuse this inconsiderate apprentice of mine. He outdoes his companions when it comes to a lack of brains. Please come in.” </p>
<p>The lad was all apologies.</p>
<p>“I respectfully beg your pardon. Please forgive my ignorance.…” </p>
<p>He felt himself about to burst as he looked into Iwa’s face. When he could no longer contain his laughter, he ran quickly to the front of the shop and he stuffed a dust rag into his mouth, mistaking it for a hand towel. That brought him to his senses. The manager looked on with a mixture of sympathy and anger.</p>
<p>“He’s half imbecile. Please disregard the rudeness of his words and actions. After all, he is just an apprentice…. Now, what can I do for the lady of the Tamiya family?”</p>
<p>“Our family is in need at the moment, and since we have a history of doing business with you, we would like to ask if we might borrow half a peck of rice.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, the mention of money was at the tip of her tongue, but somehow she could not get the words out. Jihei did not seem particularly surprised. Ever since Iemon had taken charge of the affairs of the Tamiya household, its income was often spoken for well in advance. What is more, rumors of Iemon’s gambling were spreading among his associates. Neither Kaiho nor Akiyama, nor any of the others involved in the plot, were likely to pass up the chance to get their hands on the fine pickings to be had from the Tamiya family holdings. Jihei was quick to answer.</p>
<p>“I understand your request. I will see that it is sent on to you… Oh, I see. You need it immediately? Matsu! Measure out half a peck of rice for Lady Tamiya and arrange for its transport. And place one bu in the parcel. It’s a long way to Yotsuya and the porters can be demanding with their fee.”</p>
<p>Iwa’s heart leapt with gratitude at Jihei’s foresight. He watched her disappear into the distance. Then he took out his ledger and next to the name “Tamiya” he wrote a question mark.</p>
<p>It was dusk by the time Iwa had returned home to Samon-chō. She was startled to find Iemon seated downcast before the unlighted brazier.</p>
<p>“A fine hour this is for a woman to be wandering the streets. And my meal? Not ready. Impressive manners for a wife! You owe your lord an apology for having wronged him. But to make the meal you had first to find enough money….”</p>
<p>Iwa did not speak.</p>
<p>“So there is money or at least a way to get it? Where is it? How much are we talking about?”</p>
<p>“No,” she replied. “I have the rice with me. This one bu is only enough to purchase some eels and raw fish, and perhaps some trimmings….” She paused at Iemon skeptical frown. He was eyeing the rice and money when the markings on the bag caught his eye.</p>
<p>“Where did you get this rice from? And the money? From Jihei, the rice broker? You visited him dressed up like that? You’ve really gone and disgraced our house, not just by being ugly but by behaving so badly. Who could expect to stay in a hole like this?”</p>
<p>Iwa threw herself in his way as he rose to leave the room. Clinging to his sleeve she begged for forgiveness, as only a woman who had done no wrong can do. With a cruel look on his face, Iemon turned on her. She felt like fleeing for her life, but she could only crouch like a dog to protect herself from the repeated blow of his fists. Then with a violent kick to the groin, he rolled her over and stomped off.</p>
<p>Soon after, Iwa heard footsteps. Had Iemon returned? She pulled herself partway up, wincing from the pain. It was Kondō Rokurobei. The portly man threw up his arms, horrified and saddened at what he saw.</p>
<p>“Iwa, what happened here? I’ve heard the rumors of what is going on. The tatami mats, the folding screens, the cabinets, the dressers—your home has been stripped bare to feed the greed of others. And now he has shrunk to beating you! He is a thoroughly wicked sort.” Kondō’s voice exploded in anger.</p>
<p>“This cannot go on. I feel responsibility for the Tamiya family and its ancestors. You must not be subjected any longer to such treatment. A divorce will have to be arranged. Let him depart with his plunder. Give him everything, only rid yourself of him. He may be the husband and head of the house of Tamiya, but he is no match for me. I will draw up the divorce papers. As head of the ward, Master Itō is sure to take notice of the whole affair, too. Under all that pressure, Iemon will have no choice but to sign a letter of divorce.” </p>
<p>Kondō appeared overcome with righteous indignation. Iwa spoke slowly, struggling through her pain.</p>
<p>“Don’t be hasty. Iemon has not been a good man, as I know only too well. He buys women at Naka-chō. He pays for geisha. He gambles. These are a the vices of a man about which I have nothing to say. I am his wife, and that means maintaining the home for both our lives, in good times and bad. A proper wife does not resort to divorce to cover for mistakes. I want nothing to do with such measures. But weren’t you our go-between? Was it not you who arranged the marriage between Iemon and me? Use that role to talk to Iemon. Rebuke him. Make him stop this gambling.”</p>
<p>Rokurobei could hardly hear her out before his impatience got the better of him and he interrupted to protest.</p>
<p>“This is complete madness, utter folly. How can you allow this fellow to ruin your family? He will squander your entire income.”</p>
<p>Undeterred, Iwa picked up where she had left off. </p>
<p>“The house and all its possessions belong to Iemon, to do with as he pleases. I am his wife and must submit to his wishes…. If you cannot accept that, you are no longer a friend and your services as a go-between are no longer needed.”</p>
<p>What had gotten into the soul of this gentle woman? Kondō backed away alarmed at the look she gave him.</p>
<p>“You really are a demon! Your mother Mino has returned to life. Demon! You’re not even human. I’ll have nothing more to do with you or your affairs.” </p>
<p>He left her then and there, helpless as she was. Without even stopping to put on his clogs, he fled barefoot from the house in Samon-chō. </p>
<p>12 Kaiho’s Revenge</p>
<p>Kondō Rokurobei headed directly for his co-conspirators, whom he found assembled in Itō’s house. Kaiho, Iemon, Hana, Chōzaemon, and Kihei were all drinking saké. As usual, Kaiho was bragging about having lost none of his youthful prowess with the passing of the years. Hana laughed at him behind his back. Kihei was out of sorts, even though his share of the income had been secured. Kaiho turned on Iemon and reproached him roundly for his lack of enthusiasm. </p>
<p>“You’ve let Iwa get the upper hand. You’re far too soft when it comes to dealing with a woman who has been spoiled her whole life.”</p>
<p>Iemon listened in silence with an enigmatic smirk on his face somewhere between acquiescence and contempt. Actually, knowing Iwa as he did, he had little confidence in Kaiho or Chōzaemon for the way they were proposing to proceed. He was brewing a plan of his own which, for the time being, did not cross swords with theirs.</p>
<p>Rokurobei burst in, all worked up.</p>
<p>“What an experience! The woman is a proper fiend. I forgot my new pair of clogs at your house, Iemon. I just bought them yesterday.”</p>
<p>Iemon looked at Kondō standing there terror-stricken in his bare feet. He erupted into howls of laughter. Kaiho was indignant.</p>
<p>“Just because you´re afraid, that’s no excuse for trampling on the tatami with your dirty feet. Let’s give get him some water so he can wash off. I realize you are now only a resident in Kondō’s house, but for the moment please play the role of the lady of the house.”</p>
<p>This was part of the arrangement. Along with the possessions of Iwa, Hana was to be handed over to the reliable charge of Rokurobei so as to give Iemon easy and respectable access to both of them.</p>
<p>“What happened after I left Samon-chō?” Iemon asked. Master Kondō seems to have had a bit of a fright.” </p>
<p>Kondō huffed and fumed as he cleaned his feet at the front step.</p>
<p>“Master Iemon, he grumbled, “ you’re done for, I can tell you that. What was it she said—three years? Her face was horrible. I will have nothing more to do with this business, and I will not be going back to Samon-chō. Woe is me! I may never sleep again. The very thought of being haunted in the next life by such a foul obake….”</p>
<p>Kaiho asked, “Did Iemon really beat her? He said he did.”</p>
<p>Kondō replied, “She could barely move her arms and legs. Not a spark of her love for Iemon is left, yet she clings to the honor of the family and the duties of a wife to the household. There is no changing her mind. And now I have come under a cloud for not carrying out my responsibilities as a go-between. You had better look out for yourselves. If she ever suspects what is really going on and even gets an inkling of the truth—you’re all in for it.”</p>
<p>Kaiho listened seriously; Iemon seemed disinterested. None of them could think of anything other than the plot they were now caught up in. A week passed, then ten days. During that time every effort was made to get Iwa to consent to a divorce. Kaiho summoned her to his house as head of the ward. Iwa broke down in tears at the kindness and sympathy he showed her. Iemon’s scandalous treatment of her had come to his attention, but why had he not heard of it before things got to this point? He directed his indignation on the emissary who had brought Iwa to him, Akiyama Chōzaemon, a neighbor of the Tamiya who lived near the Ten’nō Shrine. In no time the head of the ward he had become completely absorbed in his pretense.</p>
<p>“I always took that Iemon—or should I say, Kazuma—for a scoundrel. Why bring an outsider like him into the ward? But here he is, master of the Tamiya family and successor to the distinguished, if somewhat bull-headed, Matazaemon. How sad to hear that his debts will consume the family income for the next five years. And what of the household possessions and separate properties—all gone?”</p>
<p>Iwa nodded and Kaiho was beside himself at the malice of it all. He advised her, come what may, to be prudent and accept his help. He could relocate her somewhere in the countryside, far away from the ward, where she would be free of Iemon’s influence and not have to witness the degrading spectacle he had made of the house of Tamiya—at least until such time as Iemon could be forced out. Given his history, Kaiho was confident it would not take long. In the meantime, Iwa would be passed off as a poor, weary, overworked laborer on one of Kaiho’s Shimosa farms.</p>
<p>Chōzaemon voiced his disagreement with the plan. He was the person Iwa distrusted above all others. He had always shown his disdain for her. Even in defending her conduct, he was too shrewd to allow any display of kindness. His job as a subordinate was to deliver exact reports to the ward chief. Iwa was completely taken in and felt grateful for his apparently thoughtful neutrality.</p>
<p>“Iemon is a coward. A samurai does not beat a woman or a dog. If either have been unfaithful, he simply kills the offender. Iemon’s conduct is thoroughly reprehensible. Faced with Iwa’s reproaches and no way to defend his actions, he retaliated by beating her to a pulp. Her face bears the marks of the assault. My wife tells me that the rest of her body is a mass of bruises.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Kaiho commiserated. </p>
<p>Iwa broke down in tears as he continued to fume.</p>
<p>“You must see Iemon is not a human being. He has the horns of a demon.”</p>
<p>Some days later Myōzen, chief priest of Myōgyō-ji, the family temple in Samegabashi, appeared at the Samon -chō house. Iwa looked to him for spiritual consolation in the midst of her trials, but he only chanted the same old refrain, harping on the scandal inflicted on Samon-chō because of the constant bickering at the Tamiya home. The duties of husband and wife to each other are one thing, but they also have a duty to their neighbors. There was no redeeming Iemon, that outsider! Iwa should take action on her own, he advised, and set an example for the ward by putting an end to this sorry spectacle.</p>
<p>As so often happened, Myōzen was persuaded by the sound of his own voice. He spoke with the intensity and conviction of one who had rehearsed his words carefully. Iwa heard him out with a strange chill in her heart. The graves of her dearly departed forebears were in the Myōgyō-ji cemetery. The temple had been one of the few indications of Matazaemon’s generosity, if not to say extravagance. It had profited greatly from his donations. But now the honor of the family was being pitted against the rationale of its priest and the interests of its neighbors, and all because an evil man had been taken into their midst.</p>
<p>“What you say, Reverend, touches my heart. I shall rely on the inspiration of my ancestors and seek their counsel.” </p>
<p>The priest left the house baffled. The thinly veiled censure of his words was no match for the outright disobedience and insolence Iwa had shown.</p>
<p>“Chōzaemon has failed,” said Kaiho, “but at least I’ve saved myself ten ryō and reached one of my objectives. Master Kondō, I thank you for your kindness to Hana. Do you propose to adopt her, then?” </p>
<p>Kondō made an emphatic gesture of protest and refusal.</p>
<p>“But this way you will have the collateral of goods and funds to cover your considerable expenses.”</p>
<p>“All of which belongs to Iwa, so your debt to me stands.” </p>
<p>Chōzaemon grimaced. The prospect of having pressure put on him, not to mention of having to cover the months of accumulated interest, was not a cheerful one. Kaiho, too, was visibly angry. </p>
<p>“I say, whoever would have suspected such obstinacy in the obake, who has always been so accommodating inside the home and out. She seemed such an easy mark. All we had to do was order her to leave. And now I’m at a loss on how to finally get my revenge against Matazaemon!” </p>
<p>Iemon laughed outright. Kaiho looked at him with surprise. Was this charlatan double-crossing him?</p>
<p>“Pardon me for interrupting, but you can set my mind at ease. Chōzaemon has not failed yet. At least the point is open to debate. My advice is to leave the matter to the principals involved. That would be the better course of action.” </p>
<p>He remained silent as Kaiho eyed him intently. Then he went on.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow Iwa leaves Yotsuya and you will get your revenge on the late master of Tamiya. Remember that, as a favor to the present head of the family.”</p>
<p>Kaiho grew enthusiastic. </p>
<p>“So you will be my son! Is it really true—that the obake is to be expelled from the ward in disgrace?” </p>
<p>Iemon nodded.</p>
<p>On the following day, after completing her morning ablutions, Iwa dressed up in freshly washed robes. It was the day for commemoration of the dead. She knelt down before the family altar and prayed fervently.</p>
<p>“O venerable Buddha, look kindly on me. It has not even been a year since I gave my hand to Iemon and already our house is in ruins. I am without an heir to console me, to perform the proper rituals, and take responsibility for our income. Before our esteemed Matazaemon passed away, he expressed his will to Iemon: ‘Take these things in hand. Life ahead awaits your enjoyment of them. Your revenue will be ample, but I ask that you keep the honor of the house in mind and see to the continuance of its line.’ </p>
<p>“Iemon has proved himself unworthy of that trust, and yet divorce is a scandal that a woman does best to avoid. I beg you, venerable Buddha, restore Iemon’s love for me. Turn his errant passions homewards to me, the child of the family. Bring my husband back to the Tamiya household, there to uphold its rights and secure its influence as before. That is my prayer.”</p>
<p>She arose, placed an offering on the altar, and struck the small bell with the wooden stick. Just then she heard a commotion at the entrance. Iemon bolted into the room carrying his fishing rod and basket, with Natsume Kyūzō and Imaizumi Jinzaemon right behind. All three of them were, to one degree or the other, drunk. Iwa was speechless as her eyes scanned the small party. Kyūzō knocked down the wooden cask Imaizumi was carrying on his shoulders and tumbled clumsily on top of it. None of them had even bothered to remove their filthy straw sandals.</p>
<p>“What’s it matter in a barn like this?” Kyūzō hiccupped.</p>
<p>“And tell me, Iemon, where does this saké I had Jinzaemon carry in from the kitchen door come from? Yuck! It smells like something left on the side of the road for anyone who passes by. What a stink!” </p>
<p>He gave the cask a kick, knocking out the stopper and spilling the filthy liquid on the floor. Iemon took the tub and sat on it.</p>
<p>“This is all that remains of the fine saké of the Tamiya stock. I’m hungry.” </p>
<p>He opened his basket, took out an eel, and began to skin it, when he was interrupted by a shriek from Iwa. She knelt down before him as if to make a prayer.</p>
<p>“You annoying hussy! What do you want now? Is it more advice for a husband who wants nothing more than not to have to look at his wife’s ugly face? Bah! This lump of a wench is no good for child-bearing or for housekeeping. She’s not even a good house-sitter.”</p>
<p>His knife tore into the skin of the squirming fish. Iwa took hold of his sleeve and begged him through her sobs.</p>
<p>“This is the day we commemorate the deceased. How can you take a life in our house, let alone in front of the memorial tablets on the altar! It is certain to cause them pain and could bring ill-fortune to the family, including you and me.” </p>
<p>Iemon sprang up from the tub thundering.</p>
<p>“What? You brassy slut! Am I to go without food just because the dead dislike the smell of eels?…”</p>
<p>Jinzaemon poked his head in from the hallway and Iemon had an idea.</p>
<p>“Hey, do you know how to cook eels?” </p>
<p>There was an anxious look on his round and featureless face. The last thing he wanted to do was insert himself into the spat between husband and wife. Of all the parties involved, he was the least willing to play out his role. Nevertheless, he answered routinely and without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“No, sir. Cooking is a special department and it’s not for me. I leave that to my wife. Besides, preparing eels is an art all to itself.”</p>
<p>“And here we have an artist,” Kyūzō chimed in mean-spiritedly. “Iwa is noted for her skill.”</p>
<p>“Right!” said Iemon. “You have both heard her refusal. No—you either cook this eel, wife, or I will issue a declaration of divorce on the grounds of disobedience.”</p>
<p>Iwa rose without saying a word. She went to the portable stove and began to stir the fire with the bellows. She did not dare stop even for a moment to say a prayer at the altar. The skillet was soon on the fire and the eels were sizzling in the saké. Then suddenly and without warning, Iemon gave a shout, wrapped a towel around the handle of the skillet, raised his hand, and dumped the contents on Iwa’s head. </p>
<p>“Take that!” </p>
<p>She let out a shriek and fell over backwards, writhing in pain as the scalding oil streamed over her face and down her neck and bosom. Imaizumi ran out in disgust. Even Kyūzō grabbed Iemon by the arm and protested.</p>
<p>“Now you’ve gone too far. Don’t kill her.”</p>
<p>“Kill the obake? That’s impossible.” </p>
<p>There was a chill in Iemon’s voice. He was the only one in the room with his wits about him.</p>
<p>When Iwa came to, groaning in agony, she saw someone leaning over her. Half blinded though she was, she recognized the face of Chōbei. He looked serious and his voice sounded distant and confused.</p>
<p>“What’s been going on here, Lady Iwa? It seems I have come at a bad time. My, my! The house is a wreck, too, stripped down to the bare boards, and in the middle of winter at that. Your Iemon is truly a beast—a damn brute. What can I to do? The honor of the house of Tamiya is at stake.” </p>
<p>He wrung his hands worriedly, glancing sideways at Iwa. There was nothing in his words she considered worth paying attention to. His attempts at consolation had grown stale. There was nothing new in his pity or anyone else’s for that matter. But it was those last words that caught her ear.</p>
<p>“The honor of the Tamiya. Chōbei…?” </p>
<p>He turned aside until his eyes had teared up. The charade caught her off guard.</p>
<p>“What happened?” </p>
<p>She took hold of his sleeve and drew herself close to him.</p>
<p>“I cannot say any more. Finding you in such dreadful state makes it impossible for me. Iemon has gone too far.” </p>
<p>And indeed, from Chōbei’s point of view and for his purposes, he had. These young fellows have no sense of limits, he thought to himself, not even when it comes to battering a woman. His resentment had gotten out of hand. </p>
<p>In the end, Iwa managed to break down Chōbei’s resistance and he explained the situation to her: Iemon’s name had been posted in the warehouse district of Asakusa. Debtors were pressing him from all sides. Stealing Itō Kaiho’s seal and forging a promissory note for twenty ryō was the last straw. Kaiho’s animosity toward Matazaemon had been well known and his feelings toward Iemon were no different. He was sure to track him down and oblige him to commit ritual suicide, the ultimate degradation that would spell the official end of the house of Tamiya.</p>
<p>“What’s to be done?” He looked squarely at Iwa.</p>
<p>“You have been kind to me,” she replied. Perhaps if you were to intervene….” </p>
<p>Chōbei laughed.</p>
<p>“ltō Kaiho is always kind to women, and he bears you no resentment, but it’s an affair between the two men. Kaiho’s pursuit of Iemon is his way of taking vengeance on Matazaemon and putting an end to the house of Tamiya. The temptation for him is too great; he is not to be trusted. No hint of what has just happened to you should reach his ears. Do you have any money at your disposal? Twenty ryō should so it. Iemon brought word to me only last night to say he is leaving Edo to go into hiding, after… after… making an example of… Well, you know what I mean. He’s a wicked man, more so than I would have suspected. But Iemon’s fate is not the issue. The fact is, he represents the Tamiya and can bring disgrace on the house. There’s the real problem. So you have nothing at your disposal, no money at all on hand?”</p>
<p>“Just sixty mon, not even a bu.” </p>
<p>She held out the coppers in her hand and Chōbei responded immediately and decisively. </p>
<p>“Then the only resource we have left is you yourself, Iwa. You can enter service in the licensed quarter. Leave your injuries to me; with my skills they’ll be healed in a week. Your transfer will secure the twenty ryō and cancel the promissory note without the theft of the seal ever having had to come to light. Then we can both have a good laugh over Kaiho’s anger—all for the Tamiya.” </p>
<p>He saw that Iwa was hesitating.</p>
<p>“It’s no more than a bond advanced against your person. Within a week or ten days we shall have found other sources for borrowing money and clearing the bond. That is all I can suggest, not having the means myself to cover the debt.” </p>
<p>He smiled as a thought crossed his mind.</p>
<p>“Perhaps Kaiho will end up paying the debt back to himself!” he chortled.</p>
<p>“Why not appeal to him at once?” repeated Iwa, grasping at straws to save herself from the fate so dreaded by the wife of a samurai. Chōbei’s reply was swift. </p>
<p>“Itō is well aware of the state of your house in Samon-chō. Asakusa and Honjo are too far away. A proposal of twenty ryō as surety for your employment would appeal to him; a bond against your house would not. Besides, he could not keep an eye on things from a distance even if he wanted to. All he could do is say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ without really knowing what is going on.”</p>
<p>Iwa remembered Kaiho’s advice to watch her step with Chōbei. The words and deeds of rascals like him tended to dovetail and then shift all too conveniently. A long silence followed. Chōbei’s heart beat expectantly as she stood up. After putting out the fire, she gathered up the few personal items that remained in her possession. He came to her aid as she struggled with the heavy rain doors.</p>
<p>“For the time being, accept the hospitality of my poor quarters. Your injuries need attention.” </p>
<p>She accepted gratefully and took his hand as if to kiss it. Chōbei pulled back instinctively. In his sleeve was his bill of sale for Iwa—the ink not yet twenty-four hours old—granting him guardianship and the right to employ her as a harlot and lady of the night in exchange for the nominal and duly acknowledged payment of five ryō. The transfer papers were all in order. Chōbei had drawn them up himself.</p>
<p>13 The Nighthawks of Honjo</p>
<p>The nearly seven days Iwa spent at Chōbei’s house were golden ones. Taki received the daughter of the Tamiya house cordially and with joy. Iemon had not broken completely with Chōbei during his time of prosperity and Iwa had soon come into contact with the humble and unfortunate pair. Hers was a generous heart, and Taki could not look around the house without seeing some sign of Iwa’s kindness. Her sympathy for the wrongs Iwa had suffered at the hands of her husband was genuine. She herself knew something about a spendthrift, gambling, inconsiderate spouse. That someone else should share in her lot only aroused her indignation against him. But brutality was another matter. She squared her broad shoulders as she looked derisively at Chōbei’s uneven, rickety physique.</p>
<p>At all events, the storm would pass. Itō, Kondō, and the priest Myōzen were all in agreement on that point. With Iwa now out of his reach, no place to go home to, and only hostile faces to encounter in the ward, Iemon would soon have to come to terms with things. Meanwhile, Iwa was welcome for as long as she liked. Taki resisted Iwa’s rather futile attempts to help with the demanding chores of the house. As lady of the house, she was used to directing her maids in their more disagreeable tasks, and now here she was, in the same position in this commoners’ household. Iwa had been spared the harsher lot of her mother Mino.</p>
<p>In his own way, Chōbei was as kind as his wife. He immediately set about doing repairs on his property. When Iwa produced the paste and lotion she had received from Suian to manage her complexion, Chōbei took them in hand, carefully sniffing and tasting them. When he put a small dab of paste on the end of the long chopsticks used to arrange the charcoal in the brazier, the room was filled with the smell of garlic. He look at the puffy face of Iwa, the unnatural, almost ghastly, white of the skin visible between the wide pockmarks. There was a curious streaked effect to the circles left by these scars, something one only sees in the attempts of artists to depict the supernatural or by savages to scare away their foes. Altogether, it gave a drawn and rather corpse-like look to the lower part of her face.</p>
<p>“There is more to this than meets the eye,” Chōbei mused to himself. During her stay, Iwa had one of her nervous attacks, a kind of epileptic seizure. Chōbei grew cynical and put a stop at once to all the remedies.</p>
<p>“I won’t always be around. If you take to using Suian’s medications again, no doubt they will give you some relief. But for now, they are interfering with my efforts.” </p>
<p>Clever rascal that he was, Chōbei recognized a kindred spirit in Suian, who had been bribed to render Iwa more hideous than nature had made her in order to take away her womanhood and any hope of an heir to the house of Tamiya. By poisoning? Not likely, though ignorance of leeches and their side-effects might well lead to such a result.</p>
<p>Within a week, Iwa was once more able to show herself in public. It now fell to Chōbei to see the plot to completion. He recalled Iemon’s suggestion back when it all started.</p>
<p>“Sell her as a nighthawk! No one will go near such an ugly woman.”</p>
<p>“It’s my trade your talking about. Just leave it to me,” the flesh-peddler had calmly replied. “In Yoshida-machi they even get new noses from one night to the next. Between dusk and dawn, their little beaks melt and become disfigured. Once they have served their purpose, they need to be refashioned. Leave it to me. So long as Iwa never again troubles Iemon, our work will be done.”</p>
<p>“True enough. Do as you please. Kill her, if need be,” Iemon had said. “While Iwa is in Yotsuya, though, you will feel Master Itō’s wrath and my own.” </p>
<p>Reluctantly, Iemon signed the contract Chōbei had drawn up and paid the fee of ten ryō to have this growth removed from his life once and for all. It was with a sigh of relief that he learned of Iwa’s flight into the home of the flesh-peddler. Within three days, carpenters and workers were swarming around the Tamiya house in Samon-chō. The master was making ready for his return.</p>
<p>Taki had been dispatched on a mission for Chōbei. This would insure her absence for the greater part of the day. Chōbei spoke to Iwa. </p>
<p>“Allow me to demonstrate my skills. There is more to me than you have seen.” </p>
<p>He could have passed the hideous woman off at night, but circumstances compelled him to act by day. In any case, he could count on the dusky interior of Tōemon’s entrance and drawing room to obscure her appearance. (Tōemon was the head of the guild that bought up these unfortunate streetwalkers, the basest women of their class, and took charge of them.)</p>
<p>Chōbei sat down before Iwa. Like a makeup artist in an actor’s dressing room, he was surrounded with a battery of brushes and spatulas, pastes, creams of all shades of grey, flesh color, pinks—even reds. His skillful hands set to work transforming his subject. There was no question of making her beautiful. The best he could do was make her passable.</p>
<p>Spring was near at hand, but the weather was still cold. Chōbei hesitated. It was a long walk and he feared his handiwork might fade or run from the sweat of the effort. Besides, he had no desire for conversation and preferred to avoid satisfying Iwa’s curiosity as much as possible. Up until then, he had left the two women to themselves in the house and seen Iwa only when Taki was present. And so he called for a carriage and gave directions to the driver. As the rickshaw pulled away with its fair burden, he trotted along behind, busying his mind with the remainder of the plan.</p>
<p>Tōemon’s place was on the second block of Yoshida-chō, in the center of the canal district. At one end was the North Warigesui Canal; on the other, the larger, fairer, and more pretentious South Warigesui Canal. At an equal distance to the east lay the Hōon-ji Bridge, named after the great temple of Hōon-ji just across the canal that bordered the district. As the rickshaw ambled down along the banks of the northern canal, Iwa thought to herself that she had never seen a more filthy stream than this sluggish backwater current. The driver set the carriage down at the canal, a few hundred yards from their destination. As the two set out on foot, Chōbei gave her some final instructions.</p>
<p>“It is a serious offence for a samurai woman to engage in this business. But really, it’s just a formality, a pledge to ensure the return of the document your husband forged. There is no higher duty for a wife than to save the honor of the house. Isn’t that so?” </p>
<p>There was a light sob in Iwa’s voice as she nodded assent. She felt different now that she had come to the place where she was to be put to the test.</p>
<p>Chōbei went on. </p>
<p>“An agreement has been made for you as the daughter of my younger brother Kan’emon, a green-grocer from Abekawa-chō in Asakusa. Remember, the twenty ryō involved is needed to save a father facing default and the danger of imprisonment.”</p>
<p>“Our situations are not so different,” whispered Iwa.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Chōbei. “Now here is the place. Wait a moment at the entrance.”</p>
<p>He entered the house briskly and called out, “Hello….”</p>
<p>“Ah! Chōbei, is it? The master is away for the day at the magistrate’s office. Some drunkard is claiming he’s been robbed. The girl he accused was punished—perhaps unjustly. All the women in this house are honest.”</p>
<p>“What can you do?” laughed Chōbei. “Be that as it may, I come here on a matter already agreed upon. The girl is here—and a stubborn wench she is. The master said he would help me and I am grateful for that. Since she is to be sent around to the men, payment should go to Kan’emon. If she tries to get away, put a ring in her nose and treat her as a farmer would his cattle. Don’t let her get in touch with me or anyone at her home. She will lie, of course. But you are used to lies here at Tōemon’s, aren’t you?” Matsu laughed.</p>
<p>“Nothing to worry about there.” </p>
<p>She looked over the contract carefully. </p>
<p>“I see. She is to be sold for life service. Otherwise, twenty ryō would be an outrageous price to pay. Is that her?… Mmm! Doesn’t seem a very likely candidate. Step a bit more into the light…. I myself would never have closed the deal without first examining the goods. But Tōemon has left us no choice. Given the scarcity of women and his good will toward Chōbei, he would pay whatever you ask. At twenty ryō, she’s a real gem! Come on up, now.… Haru, a new girl! Take her in and show her the house and how we do things here…. Chōbei, would you like some tea?”</p>
<p>Chōbei managed to get a word into Matsu’s flood of words as the girls led the hesitant newcomer away. He spoke to her in a loud and harsh tone.</p>
<p>“Remember to obey the owner’s wife in everything. Whatever she tells you to do, do it. No nonsense. Oh, I almost forgot. A moment please.”</p>
<p>He drew Iwa aside, seeing that she was on the verge of tears. His voice became gentler. </p>
<p>“Don’t let anything surprise you; pretend to know nothing. The house of Tōemon in Honjo is not the drawing room of Tamiya in Yotsuya. Remember, Chōbei will play his part. Life is like a pleasure cruise. There are rough waters to go through, a bit of danger, and a lot of refuse to toss overboard. Please keep your household and your husband in mind. It’s only for a week—or so.”</p>
<p>“And Iemon, the house? Will they be secure?”</p>
<p>“Of that I am certain. See, I already have the twenty ryō in hand. It’s just a matter of recovering the compromising document and bringing Iemon back home. But that will take some negotiating. In the future he will behave much better.”</p>
<p>Chōbei clinked the coins in front of her. As she made her way up the stairs, he returned to the brazier and Tōemon’s wife, who had prepared a simple tea. Chōbei was on pins and needles as he sipped from the cup, fearing an outburst upstairs during Iwa’s initiation into a vile world whose depths she could never have imagined.</p>
<p>“Yes, trade is good. Women are hard to come by. The men prefer to keep them at home rather than profit from their service elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Chōbei made small talk until he could down his tea, step into his clogs, and leave. Iwa had vanished into the inner recesses of the house.</p>
<p>Tōemon and his wife were now quarrelling. </p>
<p>“Are you out of your mind?” she railed. “Paying twenty ryō for such an ugly wench. I had no choice. I had to accept her. Chōbei is a cheat.” </p>
<p>Tōemon and the manager pulled Iwa under the light as if she were a bag of rice.</p>
<p>“The sly scoundrel! From the crown of her head down to her to neck she is all dolled up. Maybe elsewhere, too.”</p>
<p>“Still and all, she is a woman,” the manager chimed in dodgily.</p>
<p>“Never mind. We can be great artists as well, even if not as crafty as this Chōbei. Twenty-six years! She’s forty if she’s a day…. And what, I ask, might your age be?”</p>
<p>“Twenty-six,” replied Iwa distraught. </p>
<p>The wife threw up her hands.</p>
<p>“And she isn’t lying!… Haru! Kota! It is time to go out. The seven o’clock bell has already rung. Take Iwa to the gathering spot. She needs to learn our ways and where to entertain her guests…. Hurry along! Take her with the rest of you!”</p>
<p>Some ten or fifteen women had assembled in full array for the night’s campaign. Creams, powders, and plasters disguised the ravages of disease among this hardened lot who inhabited the miserable house. Haru accompanied Iwa to what they called the “gathering spot,” explaining to her that this was where they would bring guests picked up from the street and entertain them. They were not like the decadent whores who had to use the darkness of an alleyway as a reception room for their lovers. They knew that whatever saké was drunk there not only profited the house but earned them a commission to pay for their own cosmetics and other small gratifications. </p>
<p>On entering the place, Iwa shrank back to the wall in horror, only to recoil from the filth and obscenity she was leaning against. She would have fled, but the incoming crowd pressed her further inside. It was a long room, the entrance to which formed a sort of waiting room. The rest of the place was divided lengthwise into dirty little cubicles furnished only with a single tatami mat and a scummy, cynically suggestive shelf.</p>
<p>Iwa’s dread and disgust were obvious. Haru held fast to her arm to keep her from fleeing. This drew the attention of the others.</p>
<p>“Does this beauty expect an apartment all to herself? That’s a privilege for the high-class courtesans, the great concubines, the renowned beauties. Ah, my dear sister. You have to understand: this place is hell—the lowest pit of hell. There is no uptown. You have to be ready for anything and everything here, even to using a demon’s horn for a toothpick.” </p>
<p>The woman who spoke was some thirty odd years, to judge by her appearance, and had a hard face. Trembling, Iwa replied in a low voice. </p>
<p>“I didn’t come for this. I am only a pledge. Once the debt has been redeemed, I will return home. Within the week. This place makes me sick to my stomach.” </p>
<p>The bystanders laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“We all said that. The real reasons for our coming are never spoken. But rest assured, you must perform your duties or suffer the consequences. Be careful not to fall afoul of Tōemon’s wife. She is a terror when she gets angry.”</p>
<p>There was a bustle of activity among the women. Haru took Iwa by the hand. “Come along, now. Don’t make trouble. A newcomer like you is sure to be successful and please Matsu.”</p>
<p>Iwa braced herself stubbornly. Whatever the suffering, she would put up with it. A week in this place was sure to be a life in hell. She recalled the sight of her dismantled house, the image of her grandfather—anything to strengthen her will to resist. Haru left the room.</p>
<p>“Mistress, I have to report to you. The new girl refuses to serve.” </p>
<p>Matsu leaped up from her cushion and rushed into the room, pipe in hand and dressed in her nightwear.</p>
<p>“What nonsense am I hearing? Which of you sluts is refusing to perform the services of our house?…. You! The ink on the receipt for twenty ryō we shelled out for your ugly face and body is hardly dry…. A pledge, you say? A week’s service? You lie, just as your uncle said you would. You are here for a life of service as a street whore. Out with you!… No? No?”</p>
<p>She was about to throw herself on Iwa and to toss her out into the street. Then, to all appearances, her passions cooled. She was, after all, the head mistress, malevolent and pitiless.</p>
<p>“Kin, come quickly!”</p>
<p>The others were standing around Iwa now. Haru and the young girl Take pleaded with her to obey. They tried to whisk her away by force.</p>
<p>“I had to report to her,” Haru said. “It was for the best. Stubbornness like yours deserves to be punished, but I do pity you. Please, just obey. Go and perform your service. If you refuse, it will end terribly.” </p>
<p>Iwa shook her head.</p>
<p>“You are not to blame, Hara. I am grateful for your kind words. But this service is out of the question.” </p>
<p>Kin, a large, strapping woman, strode into the room. She was Matsu’s understudy and had earned the affections of her husband.</p>
<p>“A new recruit?” she inquired.</p>
<p>“Yes, and a headstrong one. One for the disciplinary shed. Enough! Out with you, all of you! Stop dawdling!” </p>
<p>The irate woman turned on her flock and they fled like frightened sheep in an open field.</p>
<p>14 The Punishment</p>
<p>Iwa stood motionless as the two women drew near and laid their hands on her. Her passivity did nothing to alleviate their roughness. Dragged, hustled, shoved, and beaten again and again, she was already badly bruised by the time they reached the “disciplinary shed,” the official term for a place of punishment set up by these establishments “for the good of the community.” During a temporary absence of the mistress of the house, a ray of kindness seemed to shine from Kin. She pointed to a six-foot square space and the rings fastened to the rafters. </p>
<p>“Don’t let your defiance get the better of you. Here you will be stripped, hauled up to those rings, and beaten until the rod breaks. Take a good look at it and be forewarned. I am no weakling.”</p>
<p>She pushed back her sleeve, showing an arm as tough and brawny as any dock worker. She eyed Iwa with disapproval as the poor woman gazed submissively at the ground, immobile except for an occasional twitching of her lips. Kin, the only person in the house, male or female, not to fear the boss lady, could only put Iwa’s courage down to ignorance. She shrugged her shoulders scornfully.</p>
<p>“A man would cause you no pain. The same cannot be said of me. You shall have proof.” </p>
<p>Perhaps if I could break through her obstinacy, she thought to herself, I could be more merciful in meting out her punishment.</p>
<p>Matsu returned with the instrument of torture, a rod of bamboo reinforced with rattan wrapping. Kin took it and held it up to Iwa’s face, bending it to display the flexibility of its sting. Iwa closed her eyes. She would ward off all temptation to weakness. A sign was given and Kin ripped away the sash. With one twist, Iwa’s tattered and rumpled kimono fell to her feet, taking her inner skirt along with it. She had no undershirt and was left completely naked. She crouched to the floor out of modesty. The cold wind of the March night made her shiver as Kin fixed the ropes to her wrists and whispered some last advice into her ear.</p>
<p>“When you’re ready to give in, just say ‘Enough!’”</p>
<p>Iwa did not react. Kin moved a ladder into place, climbed up, and passed the ropes through the rings above. Once she was back down, the two women began to hoist away, gradually raising Iwa from her position on the floor to her full height, arms extended and her toes barely able to reach the ground. At the slightest twist to relieve the strain on her wrists, an agonizing pain ran through her whole body.</p>
<p>“Still stubborn? Strike away!” Matsu bellowed. </p>
<p>Kin raised the rod and delivered a blow with full force across the buttocks. A red streak appeared. Iwa bent back her legs instinctively. The blows followed in quick succession, raising welts on her flesh as it bled from the lacerated tissue. Across the shoulder blades they fell, on small of the back, against the buttocks and the belly—all with the full force of Kin’s muscular arms and weight. Each time the legs lifted in shock, the suspended body spun round. And each time the toes returned to rest on the ground, the bamboo rod would descend with merciless ferocity.</p>
<p>The execution of the punishment seemed only to arouse the ruthless spirit of the tormentors all the more. Kin redoubled the power of her blows, seeking out the thighs, the base of the neck, the shoulders, and all the tenderest points to maximize the pain. Matsu ran from side to side, looking at Iwa’s face and her closed eyes for some indication that she was weakening from the torture or that the more agonizing blows were having their effect. By now Iwa’s body was striped and splashed with red. Kin’s hands slipped on the wet surface of the bamboo rod. Suddenly, she stopped. Blood was gushing from Iwa’s nose and eyes and mouth.</p>
<p>“Mistress, there’s no point to killing her. Please stop it here. She should be let down.” </p>
<p>Matsu examined the victim coolly.</p>
<p>“She has fainted. Lower her and throw saltwater over her body. The sting will bring her to.” </p>
<p>Kin followed the instructions to the letter. She dashed the bucket of water with great force directly into Iwa’s face.</p>
<p>“Enough,” she uttered as she returned to consciousness.</p>
<p>“She’s given in!” Kin cried out with delight. The wife was decidedly skeptical, but it was clear her assistant was done.</p>
<p>“Leave her as she is, then. There are other matters to attend to besides the whims of an idle, ill-tempered jade. Cheat me out of twenty ryō, would she? Well, time will show who the winner is.” </p>
<p>And with that, she walked off “to drink my saké, clip my nails, and sing obscene songs to the accompaniment of a shamisen.”</p>
<p>Iwa lay semiconscious, bound hand and foot in that cold punishment shed. At midnight the girls returned to their “home.” They gathered around the outstretched Iwa. From Kin they had gotten some inkling of the courage she had displayed. They admired her, but none of them dared touch the ropes that still held her fast. At last, Haru, who had been unusually successful in that night’s outing, ventured to approach the half-drunk mistress of the house.</p>
<p>“I am here to make my report,” she announced, spreading out her earnings before her gratified mistress. Then she added timidly, “Iwa repents. Please release her from punishment. She looks quite ill and weak.”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Matsu fired back. Then, as she started to think of the possible loss from the after-effects, she gave in. “She may be untied and sent to bed.”</p>
<p>“And food?”</p>
<p>“Let her earn it,” the woman snapped back. Haru bowed humbly and slipped away. That night the girls contributed from their own provisions to feed Iwa, as they did the following days and nights. Matsu would have stopped the practice had Tōemon not interfered. He wanted to keep his deteriorating stock in as good repair as possible and to that end to see them properly fed.</p>
<p>“The woman is not to be starved—at least not too openly. The whole matter has caused me trouble enough. From the very day this epileptic came into the house she has brought havoc. Beat her if you will, but not enough to kill her.” </p>
<p>Once again, Matsu followed his words to the letter. One beating was followed by another, but always with enough of an interval between to ensure recuperation and avoid endangering her life. These scenes came to be regarded as a form of recreation for the house. The other occupants were allowed to attend, both in order to make an example of her and to feed their fascination with torture. In time, Matsu gave up. Amusement was one thing, but her hatred of Iwa was tempered by the desire to find some way to make use of her and get a return on the twenty ryō she had been swindled out of. In the end, she took the manager’s advice.</p>
<p>“The men in the house must not be tempted to witness this and the other girls do not have time to be making a spectacle of Iwa. None of them have twenty ryō at stake like Chōbei. Let her wash the dishes.”</p>
<p>Thus was Iwa “degraded” from her lofty status as a streetwalker to a kitchen drudge. She wept with joy and nearly forgot the whole matter of the pledge as she settled into her new and more pleasant demotion. The time, the place, and perhaps the medication she was taking took their toll on Iwa’s mind. Iemon, the house at Samon-chō, the memorial tablets on the Buddhist altar, the splendid garden—all transformed into the thin tissue of a dream by labors that left her thoroughly exhausted at the end of each day as she collapsed onto the straw charcoal wrappings in her shed. After one year of service, Iwa of Samon-chō had gone numb. But unforeseen events were about to take place.</p>
<p>There was excitement in the house. Mobei, a dealer in combs, brushes, jewel strings, and other trinkets, stood outside the gate. The women clustered around the wares laid out on his trays. Mobei wandered throughout the wards of Edo with his little trays fitted neatly into each other and wrapped up in a large carrying cloth. His wares were a marvellous collection of things precious and common, from antique jewelry made of genuine coral and tortoise shell, to curious carved ornaments of great value, to counterfeits made out of painted wood, animal horns, and colored glass.</p>
<p>“Mobei, we’ve been waiting a long time for you to visit. Do you have a round comb on hand?”</p>
<p>“You put me on the spot. My sincerest apologies, madam. I have only this…. How much? Only one bu…. Too high, you say? Not at all! For a woman in an ordinary walk of life, it is a month’s wages, but to a noble courtesan such as yourself, it is but a night’s trifle.”</p>
<p>The other women tittered. Haru was a bit nettled at the high­falutin title but did not show her irritation. Mobei continued his sales pitch. Before her and the others he laid out several strings of fake “coral” jewels made out of skillfully tinted paste.</p>
<p>“Have a look, if you please. I can let you have them for only one bu and two shū. If they were the genuine article, they would run you twenty ryō.”</p>
<p>“Do you have real ones?”</p>
<p>The dealer laughed. Out of pity, but to give them a glimpse of the distant world above their station, he raised the cover of a box in the lower tier. They gasped in admiration at the luxurious pink of genuine coral. Hands stretched through the grating to touch it but Mobei quickly replaced the cover.</p>
<p>“For some great lady,” sighed Haru.</p>
<p>“Just so,” replied Mobei, adjusting his boxes. </p>
<p>That day he sold two painted wooden combs and a string of beads carved out of horn made to look like tortoise shell. He pocketed the hundred mon copper coins, the ones with a hole in the center for stringing together.</p>
<p>“The necklace, by the way, is for none other than the great beauty of the Yamadaya, the lover of Master Kihei of Yotsuya,” he added. “And the gold and tortoise-shell hairpin is for the honorable wife of Master Iemon, the samurai vassal. But I supply not only the secular world. This one here is for one who has left the world, the priest Myōzen of Myōgyō-ji. It is a gift from Master Itō. Yotsuya, you see, houses some of my top clientele.”</p>
<p>He took a box from his sleeve and showed them a string of prayer beads made of pure crystal. Even in the dull twilight, the stones flashed and sparkled. But the women were uninterested. To them, a monk was not a man—not in the ordinary sense of the word anyway.</p>
<p>Mobei threw his pack over his shoulders. </p>
<p>“Next time, please don’t forget to bring me a comb with black spots that looks like a tortoise shell.” </p>
<p>Mobei nodded. As he turned to leave, he stopped abruptly. One of the women was jeering.</p>
<p>“Here’s Iwa. Surely there is something she wants to buy. Look, Mobei, a customer for you with lots of customers of her own and a full pocketbook.” </p>
<p>The women thought of Iwa’s assignment to the kitchen as the lowest one could fall. Mobie gasped at the sight of the newcomer. Iwa was just headed out the door of Tōemon’s house, food strainers for repair in one hand and fifteen mon for tōfu clasped tightly in the other, when she came face to face with peddler.</p>
<p>“What? The lady of Tamiya—here!”</p>
<p>“The lady of Tamiya!” the others echoed in a mixture of astonishment and curiosity.</p>
<p>Iwa was quick to reply. “You must be mistaken. I am Iwa. The lady of Tamiya…” </p>
<p>Hastily she pulled her head scarf over her face, and in doing so, the coins slipped from her hand. If even one mon was missing, that would mean no tōfu and a visit to the disciplinary shed for sure. Mobei stooped down to recover the last coin, and at that, all doubt was removed.</p>
<p>“It is the lady of Tamiya. There’s no denying it.” There was nothing more Iwa could say.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am Iwa of the Tamiya family. Mobei, a word if you please.” </p>
<p>The women were whispering to each other.</p>
<p>“He called her lady,” said Haru. “There always was something suspicious about her. So ugly and yet with such a grand air about her. And to think of how she put up with the punishment. Truly she must be a samurai’s wife.” </p>
<p>Their thoughts turned to Master Tōemon and how he would take the news.</p>
<p>Iwa had drawn Mobei a short distance from the grating and spoke, eyes downcast.</p>
<p>“I beg of you, Mobei, say nothing in the ward of this meeting with me.”</p>
<p>Mobei gestured sincerely that he had understood.</p>
<p>“Things had gone badly at Tamiya. Iemon was seduced into gambling by Natsume Kyūzō and Imaizumi Jinzaemon. He was swept away by passion. It was no longer possible for him to remain in Samon-chō, but things only got worse with him. I found support through the kindness and advice of Itō, Akiyama, and Kondō. But I disobeyed and did not follow their advice. Still, I am grateful. I cannot leave this place. If it had been possible, I would have owned up to things, but an important matter arose. Chōbei stepped in and saved the situation. This place is terrible, but the consequences of not coming would have been worse. I owe thanks to Chōbei. He offered me the opportunity to show my faith and courage as a wife.”</p>
<p>She looked Mobei in the face with courage. It was the peddler’s turn to be confounded.</p>
<p>“Honorable lady, haven’t you heard?”</p>
<p>“Heard what?” Iwa answered in some bewilderment. “What more is there to know? When I left Samon-chō, the house was falling completely apart. The light poured in as if the walls were bamboo screens…. Oh, my. Have things gone badly with the master in my absence?” </p>
<p>Mobei shook his head in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me! Has misfortune come to Itō, Akiyama, or Kondō, without so much as a word of condolence from me? Or is it Chōbei? His situation was so precarious….”</p>
<p>The homely creature in her poor, isolated world could only think of her friends in need. Mobei sank to his knees before her. He raised his eyes, filled with tears of pity and indignation.</p>
<p>“You mean the daughter of Tamiya knows nothing of what has happened in Yotsuya? I cannot remain silent. Nothing has happened to Iemon, Itō, or Akiyama. Your absence is being explained another way. It is said you have abandoned house and husband to run away with a commoner, the manager at the green-grocer’s on Shinjuku road. That’s the story going around.”</p>
<p>Iwa drew back as one would recoil from a snake.</p>
<p>“You’re lying, Mobei! Why would you tell me such a tale? Can I not still hear the words of Itō, Akiyama, and Chōbei ringing in my ears? What else have I had to console me during these bitter months but thoughts of their kindness to me? This skimpy wadded dress, these bare feet in the snow, this life of degradation—are they not proof of my struggle to uphold the honor of my house and my husband? Slander only beings evil on good men, Mobei. Lies, all lies!”</p>
<p>He grasped her dress, weeping. “The lady of Tamiya is a saint. Alas, she knows nothing of the wicked hearts of men. How could I ever try to deceive you? You have always been too kind to me. Please, listen to me. Was it not a year ago to the day that you left your house in Yotsuya?”</p>
<p>Iwa turned to him with a look of alarm. He continued.</p>
<p>“One week ago I passed through Yotsuya. I have many customers there, and they’re not too picky about prices, so I bring the best of my wares. When I came to your house in Samon-chō, there was a celebration underway. Itō was there, as were Akiyama, Natsume, Imaizumi, Kondō, and, of course, Hana. They were all making merry and Iemon poured me a cup of saké.</p>
<p>“‘Mobei, Mobei, come over here! Empty this cup in honor of the occasion. Today we celebrate the anniversary of the obake’s eviction. The demon has been exiled from the paradise of Yotsuya. Namu myōhō renge kyō—Praise the Buddha!’</p>
<p>“I was astonished—‘The obake…. What obake?’</p>
<p>“‘Why, Iwa, of course. A year ago, with the help of these good friends and one more not with us today, Iemon freed himself from the clutches of that accursed spectacle. Our commander drew up the formal papers of divorce. Tamiya Iemon, the son of Takahashi Daihachirō, alias Yanagibara Kazuma, no longer has to wake up at night in fear. Iemon’s gratitude to Master Itō for the favor is beyond measure.’</p>
<p>“The daughter of the Tamiya an obake? I almost fainted with outrage. I took the cup and politely returned to the hallway where I dumped it on the ground. The poor woman, I thought to myself, not only has she been driven from her home, she has been cheated out of her possessions on the false pretense of covering gambling debts. Once the heinous plot had been carried out, they were returned from storage at Kondō’s place. The whole thing has been a conspiracy from the start, cooked up by Iemon with Itō, Akiyama, Chōbei, Kondō, and who knows who else. They bragged about it and laughed in my face as they recounted the details. My poor lady! It was Chōbei who had Itō draw up the divorce papers, and within a month, Hana had left her shelter at Kondō’s house to become the new lady of the Tamiya house. Look what I have here: a jewelled hairpin ordered by Iemon as a gift for his new bride. And this: a gift of ltō’s for the priest Myōzen in gratitude for his ‘contribution to the cause.’”</p>
<p>Iwa stood frozen on the spot. It was as if her soul had been flooded with light at Mobei’s words. Step by step, she retraced in her mind the course of the infamous conspiracy against her honor and wellbeing. She had been duped, betrayed, and degraded by Itō Kaiho, the enemy of Matazaemon, and by Iemon, the son of his longtime rival Takahashi Daihachirō. Crouched and huddled at her feet, Mobei watched uneasily as a sudden and harrowing change came over Iwa’s face. At first she spoke with difficulty, in a whisper, but gradually her words whipped up into a raging torrent.</p>
<p>“Cheated, deceived by that inveterate foe of our house! And here I lie, bound and helpless! It is clear to me now. The end is at hand. The the poison, oh, I can feel the poison flowing into my heart. A curse on that man! A curse on the woman who schemed to take over the role of the rightful wife. Time is of the essence and now is the moment. The light has shone on Chōbei’s dark words. Hana conspired with that venomous leech. Iemon brought me to the foul life of this brothel, thinking it would kill me. </p>
<p>“I call on all the gods of Japan, on all the buddhas of the universe, on the all-powerful and provident Amida, on Kannon the merciful—heed my prayer. Emma, king of the underworld, I beg you, do not summon this daughter of the Tamiya house before your dreaded throne of judgment for seven lives to come, not until my vengeance has been satisfied with the agonizing death of these her persecutors. May the sacred mantra of the Lotus Sutra once inscribed on my heart in assurance of salvation be seared out with a hot iron. I set the curse of Iwa on Itō Kaiho, Iemon, Akiyama Chōzaemon, Chōbei, and each and every one engaged in this vile plot. May the revenge of Iwa of the house of Tamiya fall on Natsume, Imaizumi, and Yoemon. Oh gods and buddhas, grant my prayer!”</p>
<p>She pushed against the front of Mobei’s robes roughly. He let out a scream of horror at the frightful countenance before him. Two diseased dots flashed like sharp and gleaming swords from beneath the puffed and bulging eyelids of the morbid, swollen, round, broad white face that stood over him. He was petrified at the apparition. One of her eyelids drooped hideously onto the cheek below. The physical effort it took to talk exposed a menacing row of thick black teeth from the corner of her mouth. It was as it they were about to sink themselves into his throat in alliance with a pair of muscular hands whose nails dug into his skin. Hedged in by a wild and disheveled head of hair, Mobei felt trapped, alone in space with only the bloodcurdling vision that bore down upon him.</p>
<p>“My lady Iwa! Lady Tamiya! I haven’t done anything. It’s all the work of the others. I am not guilt of anything…. Ahhh!”</p>
<p>Convulsed with fear and pain, he rolled over on the ground as if dead. Two of the women, Take and Kota, rushed to his rescue screaming and shouting. By now Iwa was completely possessed by the malady that had overcome her. Take staggered ahead, covering her face with her hands to block out the horrible sight as she tried to wipe the blood streaming into Mobei’s eyes and cheeks from the deep slashes Iwa’s nails had torn into his flesh. Kota grabbed Iwa by the waist and shoulders from behind, only to be met by the sharp jab of an elbow under the chin. Kota’s neck and jaw cracked as she fell to the ground in a heap, as if dead.</p>
<p>Moments later a mad demon was seen charging through the crossing at the North Warigesui Canal. A samurai’s attendant who happened to be passing by stepped aside rather than risk interfering. The figure stopped briefly at the banks of the canal. Then came a dull splash, as if a heavy body had been dumped into the water. The attendant rushed forward but there was no sign of anyone. Calling for help was impossible in such rural areas and he was hardly inclined to throw himself into the sewage on a whim. He hastened back the crowd that had gathered around the motionless body of Mobei and the wenches moaning from punishment of their own.</p>
<p>15 Chōbei Gets the News</p>
<p>The attendant stood over the peddler as he came to. The eyes of the two men met in astonishment. “Why, it’s Mobei! A quarrel over your wares with the revolting women of the district, was it?”</p>
<p>“Kakusuke, I have so much to tell you. Iwa….” The attendant of the samurai Itō Kaiho was all ears.</p>
<p>“I had the misfortune of meeting up with the lady of Tamiya. She was in a pitiful state and had no idea what was going on. When I told her the whole truth she turned on me and you see the results. Would that the matter ended there! She swore revenge ‘for seven lives to come’ against your master Itō, against Iemon and his wife Hana, and anyone else involved in the plot. Her anger will not be appeased until each and every one of them is caught and put to death. She invoked the aid of all the gods and buddhas, and even of Emma himself , king of the underworld. Look out for yourself, Kakusuke. Seek employment elsewhere.”</p>
<p>At last Kakusuke had raised the clawed and battered peddler to his feet.</p>
<p>“Mobei, you were foolish to do what you did. Tell me what this is all about.”</p>
<p>As Mobei began to fill in the details, Kakusuke grew pensive.</p>
<p>“Much of this I am hearing for the first time. A servant only picks up bits and pieces of the goings on. I have just been dispatched by Master Itō to the Inagaki residence near Hōon-ji—something to do with the recent adoption of Kihei into the master’s family.…. So that scoundrel Chōbei sold the lady of Tamiya to whore for Tōemon. What a shame! She deserves better. One way or another, their aim is to kill her off and Chōbei was a paid accomplice. Where is this brothel?”</p>
<p>Surrounded by the women of his house, Tōemon listened in to the excited talk. Take was crying in pain and anger as she stood before the mirror examining her face for cuts. Kota had regained consciousness and lay groaning in a corner while the others applied cold compresses to her broken jaw. Tōemon looked sidelong at Kakusuke as he entered supporting the lame and wounded Mobei.</p>
<p>“Look to this man’s wares scattered on the roadway, and take care of him.”</p>
<p>Tōemon spoke brusquely and with authority, but he could not afford to ignore Mobei. He turned to him in a pretense of concern.</p>
<p>“Well, now, this is a terrible punishment. Your face is flushed like a plum blossom…. Haru, run to Wakiyama’s. Kota is badly hurt and his skills are needed. Stop at the drug store. Here, this will cover the cost of a balm for this good fellow’s wounds. Who would have thought that a woman of Tōemon’s household would treat others so badly. When we catch up with her, the punishment….”</p>
<p>“Enough!” cried Kakusuke. He was already involved in his master’s interests. “How does it come that Lady Iwa is here at the house of Tōemon in the first place?”</p>
<p>“Lady Iwa?” The brothel-keeper pretended surprise and turned to Mobei, “It is true, then, what the women report, that Mobei addressed our Iwa as ‘Lady?’ Who is this Iwa?”</p>
<p>Kakusuke’s response was chilly. “Lady Iwa is the granddaughter and heiress of Tamiya Matazaemon, a ranking constable. She is the wife of the vassal Tamiya Iemon.”</p>
<p>Tōemon was taken aback. “The heiress and wife of a samurai vassal? I had not the slightest inkling of her standing. It’s an outrage the way Chōbei has manipulated me.” </p>
<p>He turned scornfully toward his wife, Matsu.</p>
<p>“What rank stupidity! If I’m to have any peace, I have to find you a head first. Why not treat the woman kindly from the start and hear her story out? You know what is true and what is not about the women in the house. How could you fail to see that Iwa was a target of malice? Chōbei’s lies and your foolishness will be the ruin of our house. Since when are samurai women sold into a life of service? Idiot! Imprisonment and exile await anyone implicated. I will end up living out my remaining years among the barbaric fishermen of Sado.”</p>
<p>He would have struck her had Kakusuke and the manager not stepped between them. The woman did not budge. She stood there defiantly with her arms folded.</p>
<p>“You were the one who arranged to buy her and you were the one who blindly trusted Chōbei. How can you put the blame on me? Since when have any women been exempt? The rule of the house is, they perform their service or they get punished. It’s one or the other. You remember Seki and how she left the house—in a box. That was some time ago and you had to answer to the authorities for it.”</p>
<p>Catching herself in the presence of strangers, she broke off and whispered in the ear of her husband. </p>
<p>“This is not the time to be quarrelling. The people in the house will not say a word, for their own good. As for this worthy gentleman, Lady Iwa was neither his wife and heiress nor that of his master. You have been a poor host to our guest. Leave Mobei to my care.”</p>
<p>Tōemon recovered his composure. Kakusuke was a samurai’s attendant. There was a reason he had come to Tōemon’s house instead of reporting immediately to his master and to Iemon. Naturally, Tōemon misinterpreted his motives and Kakusuke was all too ready to profit from the mistake. He was equally courteous both to the brothel keeper and to his wife. Matsu and her women carried Mobei off to salve his wounds and regale him with fish and saké. Besides taking care of him, they made a careful inventory of his goods and repacked them, after making a substantial number of purchases. What more could Mobei ask for? His valued prayer beads, the necklace, the hair pin, and all his other treasures were unscathed. His coffers were palpably swollen, more handsomely so than his face. All in all, the beating he took had turned out a good day’s haul and he felt comfortable in the good hands of Matsu and her women. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Kakusuke and Tōemon were sitting down over saké. From the attendant and the peddler Tōemon had gotten a good sense of the predicament he was in. Things were bad but not beyond salvaging. When the time came for Kakusuke to leave, having once again outstayed his welcome, his host knelt down and pushed a golden ryō his way, wrapped up in paper sufficiently transparent for the yellow gleam of its contents to shine through.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the trouble and delay this has caused you. I hope you will be able to forget the events of the day, good sir.”</p>
<p>Kakusuke replied in kind, politely.</p>
<p>“Think nothing of it. I am only grateful for the hospitality you have shown me. This is all I shall remember of an otherwise humdrum day.”</p>
<p>Tōemon took delight and consolation from the words.</p>
<p>No sooner had Kakusuke departed than the chief of the “night-hawks” turned to his aides.</p>
<p>“Take, Haru! Aha, I see Kota has already made herself up. And you, Take, bear the scars of the episode. I want you all to go to Asakusa Hanakawado and bring Chōbei here at once. The house must wash its hands of this whole business. If he refuses to come, put a rope around his neck and drag him here.”</p>
<p>The women bowed and readied themselves for the outing, a welcome mission under normal conditions. Take was still smarting from her wounds but was not about to become an example for the others. Haru’s thoughts were dominated by the fearful curse of Iwa to which they had all been witness. If it were up to her, she would have nothing more to do with the affair.</p>
<p>Chōbei was engaged in a game of go with a hardware merchant from his neighborhood. Taki was busy at her own expertise, preparing fish and saké in the kitchen nearby. The intoxicating odors of the victuals reached the two players and properly distracted them from their game. Chōbei had just turned a handsome profit of five ryō, his commission from the hardware merchant Jūbei for having arranged the sale of his daughter to the Yamadaya brothel in Nakano-chō. Through the experience and clever negotiations of Chōbei, this enterprising commoner, who already had a son to succeed him in his own business, had exchanged her for the fifty ryō needed to prepare the way for having his second son adopted into the rival house of the ward. As these two upstanding and exemplary citizens faced off at go, they exchanged compliments and congratulations for a job well done. The merchant lavished his co-conspirator with thanks and hopes for more occasions to rejoice in the future. Taki was none too pleased when the atmosphere was broken by a sharp voice at the entrance way.</p>
<p>“Excuse me!”</p>
<p>“Who is it?” she answered crossly as she made her way to the door. “Oh, it’s Take and Haru from Tōemon’s.… And what happened to you, Take? Your, face. Why it looks as if a cat had crept into your bed at night.”</p>
<p>Take was in no mood for niceties. </p>
<p>“That’s something you might expect from your man Chōbei, but, no. These are the marks of Iwa’s nails. And where is that beloved scoundrel of yours? Is he at home?”</p>
<p>Taki could feel her blood boil.</p>
<p>“Iwa? What has Chōbei to do with her and Tōemon’s place? What do you mean by calling him a scoundrel?”</p>
<p>“Because that’s what he is. No, good woman, it’s no use getting angry.”</p>
<p>Haru stepped in. “Does your husband have a brother in Abekawa-chō who needs twenty ryō and has a daughter with nothing better to do than run after men?”</p>
<p>Taki was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Chōbei doesn’t have a brother in Abekawa-chō, or anywhere else. And if there is no brother, then obviously he can’t have a daughter named Iwa. Chōbei has no other children than the one I bore him and some girl who was staying here that has already been sold to….”</p>
<p>She stopped in mid-sentence as the pieces began to fall into place. Some months earlier she had come home to find the girl gone. Chōbei had reassured her at the time that all was well.</p>
<p>“Everything has been taken care of at Yotsuya. Master Iemon is back again with his wife, who will not be returning to live with us. We should all be happy that things have turned out so well.”</p>
<p>And Taki was happy, especially since Chōbei received funds from the Tamiya family in the days that followed. She looked from one woman to the other, her fists clenched and trembling. Take’s tone was abrasive as she tried to explain the truth.</p>
<p>“He lied to you. Nearly a year ago he brought a girl to us, claiming she was the daughter of his brother Kan’emon, and sold her into a life of service. As a nighthawk, she turned out to be useless. You can guess how our boss lady took to that, Taki. But no matter how severely she was beaten or how much blood was shed, Iwa would not agree to the work being asked of her. They tried everything, but even the men of the house would have nothing to do with her. She was simply too ugly. Finally she was demoted to a kitchen wench and given the hardest and most menial chores. But like a fool, she welcomed the disgrace.</p>
<p>“Today, by chance, she met the peddler Mobei who at once recognized her as Lady Iwa of the Tamiya family in Yotsuya. He took her aside to speak with her. Suddenly, she transformed into a demon, falling on Mobei, clutching and clawing. Kota and I ran to help him. Now she lies helpless at the house with a broken jaw—as if she’d been kicked by a horse. As for me, well you can see. Lady Iwa disappeared near the canal. An attendant saw her jump in. She probably killed herself…. So now I ask you, Taki, is your husband Chōbei not a lowlife?”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Taki. “Very much indeed. Wait here.”</p>
<p>She rushed into the inner room and confronted Chōbei.</p>
<p>“You, my fine fellow, is this a time to be playing go? Up with you! Take and Haru are here from Tōemon’s. Take them back to Honjo, where a pleasant surprise is waiting for you.”</p>
<p>Chōbei was embarrassed and enraged.</p>
<p>“What’s the meaning of this rude interruption? Can’t you see the hardware merchant is here? How dare you insult me in his presence!”</p>
<p>“I most certainly do see him,” she responded icily. “It would be better if he were at home…. Dear sir, please take your leave. Chōbei has a matter to attend to with Tōemon, the brothel keeper of the nighthawks at Honjo to whom he has sold the Lady Iwa, wife of the vassal Iemon and heiress of the late constable Tamiya Matazaemon into life service as a street whore. A man can be too clever for his own good—like this Chōbei here, who has deceived his wife and so many others. Be smart. Take the hint and leave—now! Off with you!”</p>
<p>The merchant had been sitting there speechless and panic-stricken, his eyes nearly popping out of his head. Chōbei leapt up in a rage.</p>
<p>“You hussy—keep your mouth shut! What right do you have to make my affairs public? There are many bridges to cross in life and not all of them are stable. We need money to survive and enjoy ourselves. What is important is the result, not the means used to get there. How can you be so rude to our guest? You shrew. Why, I ought to….”</p>
<p>Take and Haru interrupted his rant.</p>
<p>“Have it out with her later, Chōbei. Your family squabbles are no concern of ours. The sooner you see Master Tōemon, the better it will go for you. His anger is at the boiling point. You have the contract, right? Bring it with you when you meet with him. If you dare.”</p>
<p>“All right, all right! As for this trollop of a wife, I will give her something to remember me by.…”</p>
<p>The merchant, who was innocent of the whole affair, shivered at the threat and made ready to leave</p>
<p>“Thank you for the kind reception and the game. I will call on you later.”</p>
<p>Jūbei jumped nimbly to his feet. He dived under the sleeves of the coat Chōbei was fumbling to get his arms into and bounced out the front door, toppling Chōbei to the ground in the process and leaving him floundering in the folds of his garments and cursing uncontrollably. It was the first amusement of the day for Take and Haru. While Taki stood by, the two of them helped Chōbei to his feet and adjusted his robes. Then, flanking him on each side, the three set out for Yoshida-chō in Honjo. But not before Chōbei got in the last word to his wife.</p>
<p>“As I was saying, something to remember me by.”</p>
<p>His words were met with a savage laugh. The two women turned around for a look and hastened off, frightened, with their prize.</p>
<p>At Honjo the whole house came out to receive Chōbei. The flesh-peddler put on a haughty and confident air as he stepped into Tōemon’s presence.</p>
<p>“Did he bring the contract?”</p>
<p>Haru pointed to the sleeve of Chōbei’s coat. The manager and one of the young workers grabbed him by the arms as Haru deftly pulled out the incriminating document and handed it over to Tōemon.</p>
<p>“He can’t tamper with it or trick me any longer.”</p>
<p>Tōemon examined the paper carefully and put it aside with his own copy. Chōbei was fuming and too scared to do anything but gasp at the circle of hostile faces around him. He sat there without a cushion on the bare tatami, like a criminal squatting in the white sand.</p>
<p>Tōemon’s tone was stern.</p>
<p>“You once took tea with me. Did you really think you could get away with this? You passed off the younger sister of your supposed brother Kan’emon as a ‘popular street wench’ and sold her into life service for twenty ryō. I’m not saying the price was too high, but you cannot lie your way out of the contract that you yourself drew up. I have it right here. You get twenty ryō, I am out twenty ryō.—well and good. But now I wash my hands of the whole business. From here on, I take no responsibility. Everything falls on you now.”</p>
<p>Tōemon paused his tirade to catch his breath. Chōbei saw his chance to speak but Tōemon cut him off.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a brother. You don’t have any woman to sign off on. And the one you do have, I know just where to find her. You and your wife took Iwa in your house and then you sold her. The wife of a retainer, Master Iemon of Yotsuya, a woman who was heiress to the constable Tamiya Matazaemon—you sold her! We can trace the movements of Lady Iwa back to you. The matter needs to be taken up with the officials: the town commissioner, the police constables, and other relevant civil servants. When this whole affair comes to light….”</p>
<p>“Easily taken care of,” Chōbei broke in self-assuredly. “But honestly, sir, it’s not as serious as you think. This is all a lot of empty sound and fury. I admit, I swindled you. But I did so at the orders of others much higher up. The lady of Tamiya had become an obstacle. Master Iemon himself commanded that she be sold, and he was backed up by Itō Kaiho the head of Yotsuya Ward.”</p>
<p>“Enough of your lies,” Tōemon broke in. Kakusuke’s words were still echoing in his head.</p>
<p>“Master Iemon? Master Itō? Who else will you implicate to save your own skin? There is no trusting your kind. I’ll have nothing more to do with you. I will circulate a warning to the guild.”</p>
<p>The blood drained from Chōbei’s face. His livelihood, his very existence was at stake. He threw himself on the floor before Tōemon, dragging himself across the tatami to the small table where this despot of the nighthawks, this beneficiary of the stale refuse cast aside by others of his trade, sat and watched. Tōemon shoved him roughly with his foot. In despair, Chōbei turned to Matsu.</p>
<p>“My good lady, your husband has no reason to be angry with me. He will not lose any money and will not suffer any consequences. I beg you, speak to him on my behalf.”</p>
<p>“Since when has Matsu had anything to do with the affairs of our house? She is in charge of the women and does not overstep her bounds.”</p>
<p>The flesh-peddler reached out for Take’s feet.</p>
<p>“Please, take my side in this. My sins are venial. When no one has been hurt, one expects pardon. This will choke the life out of me and my wife and child. Won’t you step up for us?”</p>
<p>The streetwalker only sneered and her voice cracked with laughter.</p>
<p>“I’ve no interest in your commissions. I’m fed up with the matter. You’re a wicked lot and no good would come from having anything to do with you. Besides, you keep such self-important company. Officials, samurai—try and promote yourself in their world if you want. But I can assure you, the only public office you will hold is on the Ryōgokubashi Bridge.”</p>
<p>She drew away from him abruptly, cackling. He crawled his way back and forth between them. “Honorable Chōbei,” “Lord Chōbei,” “Prince Chōbei,” they taunted with their tongues sticking out. Several of the young lads employed by the house stood around at the entrance, pretending to be busy at work but keeping an eye on the scene unfolding before them. When Chōbei turned next to the manager for help, the man lifted up a long lean leg and gave him a sharp kick in the chest. He rolled over to the edge of the step leading into the house, where the strong hands of a worker were waiting to scoop him up. The next thing he knew, he was picking himself up out of the muddy snow in the street. The latticed gate of the house closed noisily behind him.</p>
<p>Confused but out of sheer force of habit, Chōbei turned around and bowed ceremoniously toward the place of his unceremonious exit.</p>
<p>“This is not the right time. I’m intruding but will call again later.”</p>
<p>The scowling glare of the manager standing at the gate brought the whole scene back to life in his mind. With all the speed his stumbling gait would allow, Chōbei bolted northward to the Azumabashi Bridge and his way home. As his tottering frame shuffled along, his mind was racing.</p>
<p>“Ryōgokubashi Bridge, the last home of the outcast beggar before the river below,” he thought to himself, shuddering at Take’s prophecy. “That’s just how it is. One scoundrel’s loss is another’s gain. Tōemon loses twenty ryō to me; Iemon’s commission comes to ten ryō; and Itō throws in another five, no questions asked. That’s a total of thirty-five ryō come my way. For a whole year this Iwa business has kept me well fed and with something left over.”</p>
<p>Chōbei’s foot tripped on a small rock in the roadway. He looked around and found himself standing before the temple of Genkō-ji. As he made to enter the maze of temple grounds and buildings standing between him and the bridge, his eyes fell on the fowl and stagnant waters of the canal. It was here, in the filthy stench of the North Warigesui Canal, that Iwa had disappeared. Chōbei stopped short. A dead mutt with copper-colored fur and a bloated belly bobbed up from out of the green slime, its teeth grinning at him. Chōbei turned quickly on his heels.</p>
<p>“A vile end, but an end all the same. Iemon wins out and I get scolded. If Itō Kaiho were not involved, the house of Tamiya would pay dearly. They would owe me double and I could not to be touched. Master Itō is not one to trifle with. There was that business with Isuke; and now, as he says, Iemon is like a son to him.”</p>
<p>A memory seemed to overtake him and his pace slowed to a crawl.</p>
<p>“Why am I in such a hurry? Here I am, rushing home to a demon, that fiendish wife of mine. I would rather face Iwa than have to deal with Taki’s temper.</p>
<p>“The gaunt hands of a ghost or the tight fist of Taki—the choice could not be clearer,” he chortled. “I have nothing to fear from the mild-mannered and merciful lady of the Tamiya. She appears to have settled matters once and for all in the waters of the Warigesui. But back home at the tenement, that’s something else. I must steel myself against the shock. One drink then another, and still another. I shall let her carping skim right over a mind dulled and wandering about in a daze. Time will calm her down. Tomorrow I shall awaken to find the storm has passed and Taki returned to the role of an obedient wench.”</p>
<p>Once near the Azumabashi Bridge, he took his prescription for domestic bliss to heart and entered the nearest drinking establishment to turn his good money into saké.</p>
<p>There was a great commotion in Asakusa Hanakawado. What had happened was this. There was an old town gossip—“Granny,” as the locals had dubbed her—who peddled the dried seaweed still known as “Asakusa nori,” even though it was being brought in from Shinagawa, Ōmori, and more distant places. The old trot had come to make a final sale to our esteemed hardware merchant whose house was just across from the tenement house where she lived and right next door to Chōbei’s place. </p>
<p>The merchant’s tongue was still wagging its recital of the day’s events, not only what he had experienced firsthand but also the revelations of Taki. He was only too willing to repeat the tale for the twenty-first time to his neighbor, the seaweed peddler. The local housewives listened in, their mouths agape. Granny was the most eager of all to hear the details, but such choice morsels of gossip were best gathered at the source, from the lips of Taki herself. Her sympathy was overtaken by her curiosity about what had transpired between Chōbei and his wife on the one hand, and the insults leveled against the hardware dealer and his household, on the other. She slipped away quickly from the assembly of busybodies and soon found herself standing at the door of Chōbei’s house.</p>
<p>“Hello, hello!…” </p>
<p>How strange, she thought to herself. Is Taki not at home? Or is she too angry to come to the door? Undeterred and unafraid, she called out again. </p>
<p>“Hello. Anybody home?” </p>
<p>She stepped up into the house and walked inside. She glanced around the kitchen.</p>
<p>“What’s this? The food is burnt to a crisp. It’s a soggy, disgusting mass. Hello, hello! It’s raining outside and the skylight is open.”</p>
<p>She set down her empty tubs in order to play the good neighbor. The first item on the agenda was to close the window to keep the rain out. Quickly and skillfully she proceeded to wipe the shining vessels dry and restore order to Taki’s usually immaculate kitchen. Women of her class are finicky about keeping house. </p>
<p>As the old woman settled into her chores, she became aware of strange sounds above. Someone was talking, but it seemed oddly to be a one-sided conversation. The voice was menacing and coaxing at the same time. Then she heard a child cry. No doubt it was Taki in the upper room, engrossed in something or other to the neglect of her husband and the rest of the house.</p>
<p>She walked over to the foot of the ladder to listen more closely. “Hello, hello!” There was no answer, just the curious, droning monotone from above, interrupted by the occasional wail of a child. It seemed to be in pain. Resolutely the stalwart old woman began to climb the rungs. When she reached the top she paused to catch her breath and look around the room. What she saw froze her to the spot in horror. A woman was kneeling over the body of a child who was squirming to free itself of her cruel, tight grip. The eerie monotone voice went on.</p>
<p>“Ah! To think you might grow up like your father. Such a wicked, unprincipled man! To sell our daughter for a street whore, and for her to spend the rest of her life in such disgraceful servitude, a woman on whose kindness this household has depended. How many times has the lady of Tamiya not visited our humble lodgings these past two years! I have boasted to all my neighbors about how she has favored us. Why, the very clothing on your puny, wretched body came from her hands. While Chōbei was spending his profits in drink and strumpets, I was fed with rice from the Tamiya house. When I delivered your tiny body, it was she who came to our aid to make sure mother and child were alive and well. That you should grow up to be like that contemptible man is beyond endurance…. But wait, I have it. If I crush your throat I will have my revenge and you will be saved from what lies ahead.”</p>
<p>She bent down low over the child. Suddenly, it gave a terrifying scream, as if had been dropped in a fire. The old gossip stood by, helplessly, struggling to find her voice.</p>
<p>“Taki! What are you doing? Get hold of yourself.”</p>
<p>She let out a frightening shriek as the woman stretched the child’s arms and legs away from its body and then, picking up the kitchen knife to her side, executed a flurry of slashes, severing the tiny limbs from the quivering body. She turned half around and looked to where the voice had come from. Jaws dripping red with blood, a broad, flat, white face with bulging brow, piercing eyes like two dots eyes flashing from behind a pair of thick and swollen eyelids—it was none other than the face of Iwa glowering at her.</p>
<p>“Eek!” The shrill of her cries echoed every which way. The old woman lost her balance and tumbled backwards down the stepladder, her head landing on the floor with a thud.</p>
<p>Neighbors and others who happened to be passing by came rushing into the house. A crowd began to gather. “Granny, what’s wrong?” Unable to speak and shuddering as if from a feverish chill, she pointed upwards. As the bystanders moved toward the stair, a loud commotion broke out on the street below. Taki had appeared at the window, her face so smeared with blood she was almost unrecognizable. In one hand she was waving a limb of the dismembered infant, and in the other, brandishing a bloody knife.</p>
<p>The onlookers were frozen with horror. A few of them shouted out to those still inside the house to run. Then suddenly, without warning, the figure at the window thrust the knife deep into her own throat, tearing at her flesh as she turned the handle. Blood spurted from the open wound and splattered on to those below who were not quick enough to get out of the way. Her body collapsed backwards into the room. The first on the scene drew back in shock at what they saw. The child’s head was half gnawed off from its body; its limbs lay scattered around the room. Taki’s body lay where she had fallen but her head was missing, as if it, too, had been chomped away. Search as they might, it was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>News of what had taken place spread rapidly. On the next block over, the story making the rounds was that the wife of Chōbei the flesh-peddler had gone mad and killed and eaten five children. A block further down, the number had risen to twenty-five. By the time word had reached the guardhouse at the Azumabashi Bridge, there were no less than a hundred adults she was said to have murdered and chewed up.</p>
<p>These rumors were mixed in with the strange report of the old woman having seen Iwa. In time, many of those who had witnessed Taki’s suicide were prepared to swear they had also seen the fearful lady of Tamiya. Chōbei first learned of the affair by being dragged out of the bar and taken to the Azumabashi guardhouse, where he was promptly put under arrest. Distraught and agitated, he knew that his life was ruined, and that it had all happened under the eyes of his neighbors, who nevertheless stood by him loyally.</p>
<p>As is often the case with goings-on in the wards, the details beneath the surface were slow to reach official ears. The involvement of the Tamiya household in what had transpired was no exception. Chōbei had suffered a great deal and was about to suffer more. His comrades in the ward remained silent as to all but the facts essential to the case. It takes time to filter out the more fantastic and unearthly elements that found their way into the story. In the end, the authorities had their own way of dealing with him. Once the coroner had made his report, the cost of further investigation and the payment of fines and bribes, together with the funeral costs, reduced Chōbei to his shabbiest garments. When he was permitted to go free some weeks later, the owner of his house turned him out and his comrades in the ward had him expelled. But enough of Kazaguruma Chōbei—for now.</p>
<p>16 News Reaches Kaiho</p>
<p>Kaiho was rapt up in the practice of his favorite arts. A saké cup stood at his side; from time to time he would lift the small ceramic bottle from the hot water on the stove to see if the temperature of the contents felt just right to his experienced hand. The procedure was carried out to the monotonous drone of a traditional ballad. Kaiho by no means confined his art of recitation to customary heroic tales. On this particular occasion, he was trying his hand at one of those bawdy songs that often spice up such tales. Kihei cheered him on as he listened in cynical amusement at the depravity of the impotent old man. Kaiho had found him an excellent drinking companion, someone with whom he would relive his former days in the “quarter” and find fresh stimulation from the adventures with which Kihei would regale him. </p>
<p>“Things have gone well. It’s half a year now that you have been my son. You have brought good fortune to the house.”</p>
<p>Kihei bowed respectfully as the old man continued.</p>
<p>“Iemon and his whore are fast destroying Tamiya with their drunken shenanigans. Chōzaemon is caught like a fish in the net. His debt of ten ryō has doubled, and he has to find some way to repay it. I’ll see that he disembowels himself if he doesn’t. And then there’s the debt I am still owed by Tamiya Matazaemon. Iwa has become an outcast to pay it off. Who knows, perhaps she is living as a beggar on some highway or other. If she shows her face in the ward asking for money to keep her wretched carcass of a body alive, I’ll send her to jail to rot with the other vagrants. But what did become of her? Iemon hasn’t said anything.”</p>
<p>Kihei shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“He’s a tight-lipped fellow and knows better than to talk about himself. He would only say that Chōbei had taken the matter in hand.”</p>
<p>Kaiho threw up his hands in a mixture of alarm and delight.</p>
<p>“Rumor has it he’s flesh-peddler. There’s no way he could pawn Iwa off in that trade. Even the lustiest devils in hell would refuse to sleep with that one.”</p>
<p>Just then Kakusuke stepped into the room.</p>
<p>“I have something to report. Master Inagaki sends his best wishes. I am here to deliver the documents of transfer in person.”</p>
<p>Kaiho took the papers and responded to the puzzled look on Kihei’s face.</p>
<p>“Your father has been good to me. The documents are for the transfer of farmlands in Kazusa in exchange for others in Shimosa. This makes it possible for the same bailiff to make both transactions at the same time and manage the combined property in both villages.”</p>
<p>“But the office…” objected Kihei, his samurai instincts reacting spontaneously against the slightest hint of irregularity. Kaiho broke him off.</p>
<p>“You should learn to follow my example, Kihei. The successor to the title owner who just died is a child. I am in no hurry to provide a proxy while he remains a minor. In time, the rights to the land will lapse and once the boy comes of age, he can be given occupation elsewhere, all of which will secure considerable revenue. For now, out of sight, out of mind. My current manager is the best, and so is the income he is pulling in.”</p>
<p>Kaiho seemed surprised that Kakusuke was still standing there, even though he had been dismissed. He looked at him intently.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Kakusuke? You look pale. Did Inagaki’s attendant take too good care of you? Have you seen a ghost?”</p>
<p>“I saw Iwa—of the Tamiya house. I wish I had seen a ghost, anything better than that demon.” Kaiho started.</p>
<p>“Iwa? Where?”</p>
<p>“At the brothel of Tōemon, chief of the night-hawks at Yoshida-chō in Honjo. She beat up the peddler Mobei badly when the two ran into each other and the blockhead blurted out everything about what had happened in the ward. She flew at him in a rage and pronounced a ‘curse for seven lives to come on Iemon, Akiyama, and Kondō.…’” </p>
<p>His voice haltered for a moment.</p>
<p>“And on you as well. Then she headed straight for the canal. Did she drown herself? I can’t say for sure. After I went to help Mobei, who was lying on the ground horribly mauled, I learned the rest of the story. It seems Chōbei had sold Iwa to Tōemon for life service as a night-hawk.”</p>
<p>Itō Kaiho sat up straight. The idle boasts of a few moments previous flashed across his mind. He knew he couldn’t count on Kihei. After all, he was a samurai who took the courage of his caste and profession seriously.</p>
<p>“An outrageous affront,” Kihei cut in. “To sell a samurai woman into such a life—it just stinks! That’s what happens when you let in a skunk like Chōbei. Did Iemon know of his intentions?”</p>
<p>Kaiho diverted his eyes from Kihei’s probing gaze.</p>
<p>“I can’t say what Iemon did or did not know. But he must hear of this at once. Kakusuke, hurry over to the Tamiya house and announce that I wish to consult with Iemon.”</p>
<p>Kihei paced back and forth across the room, fidgeting and fuming. At last he spoke up.</p>
<p>“With your leave, I would like to excuse myself, father. You have something to discuss with the fortune-teller that I find anything but entertaining.”</p>
<p>As he was walked out, Iemon was just walking in. They nodded frigidly in one another’s direction. Iemon knew that Kihei despised him as much as he feared and hated Kihei.</p>
<p>“Please don’t go far in case I need you,” Kaiho called out good-naturedly. Actually, he was relieved to see his self-righteous son leave. There was something about his courage and inflexibility that frightened Kaiho and made him feel ashamed to expose his own weakness in the presence of others. He broke the news immediately to Iemon.</p>
<p>“Kakusuke has seen Iwa.”</p>
<p>Iemon looked at Kaiho curiously. Was that fear he was seeing? The former monk replied.</p>
<p>“What of it? She lives in Edo. It’s only natural that Kakusuke would run into her, especially given his social status.”</p>
<p>He smiled grimly.</p>
<p>“But…” Kaiho countered and plunged headlong into the story of the attendant and all its details. Iemon listened intently.</p>
<p>“Chances are she’ll come here.”</p>
<p>“Here?” bellowed Kaiho.</p>
<p>“What do you expect?” answered Iemon. “If it’s revenge against me or you or the other, where else could she go but Yotsuya? We must not run away.”</p>
<p>Kaiho was taken aback at how calm he was.</p>
<p>“And what about you? Will you open the house of Tamiya to receive its former lady and mistress?”</p>
<p>“A beggar and outcast pushing herself on us? Her corpse will lie chopped up in the ditch and left for the trashmen to collect and feed to the dogs in the swamp. I would ask you, honorable sir, to follow my example.”</p>
<p>Kaiho’s round eyes protruded from his round face. He leaned over and touched Iemon on the sleeve. Fear was written all over him and it caught Iemon by surprise. Beneath all his bluster, the old man was an arrant coward. Villains should understand each other—as he and Chōbei did. But it was as if he had been hoodwinked by this old fool all along. It should have been he that put up a front, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Kaiho lowered his voice.</p>
<p>“Kakusuke wasn’t able to see her before she vanished into the waters of the Warigesui Canal. What if Iwa has come back as a ghost to avenge herself against me…?”</p>
<p>He drew himself erect, bewildered and not a little annoyed at the condescending smile playing on the face of Iemon, who was amused not at what had transpired but at the fact that he had at last found the weak spot in a man who had previously lorded it over him. For now, it was the situation that had both of them under its control. If Iwa were actually to show up in the flesh, it would be most unsettling for all concerned. They must stand together. Iemon addressed the old man sternly.</p>
<p>“All that money and you’re afraid of ghosts! Do you not take two bodyguards when you travel outside the city? Do you tremble when you have to meet with your lord? If the power of your flesh-and-blood enemies does not frighten you, what is there to fear from a disembodied spirit who has no physical means to vent its anger and hostility? It’s all in your imagination. No one is more helpless than the dead. Their time and place for working havoc have come to an end. If Iwa returns to Yotsuya, it will be in her own person. And I can assure you, our ward commander knows how to deal with Iwa the beggar and night-hawk.”</p>
<p>“Then you knew the fate that befell Iwa?”</p>
<p>“First hand, from Chōbei himself. That skinflint turned a profit from the whole affair. I had no wish to see him or arrange for him to be invited to the dinner that Mobei was an unfortunate witness to…. But please, call for some saké. Let us clear this bad air with proper spirits. Honorable sir, allow me to be your guest.”</p>
<p>Iemon’s manner was not entirely natural, as Kaiho would have noticed had he been his usual self. Instead, he felt greatly relieved. If anyone knew about ghosts and could speak of them with authority, it would be a monk. Not that any odor of sanctity still lingered about the person of Iemon, but the fact that it once had was enough to satisfy Kaiho. He responded accordingly.</p>
<p>“Saké it is, then! Bring us some saké!”</p>
<p>As if by magic, Kihei appeared at the sound of those welcome words. Much as he disliked Iemon, he liked saké more. The servants scurried about, warming up the saké once and then warming it up again. Plates of fish were carried in—of course, with more saké. It was late when Iemon finally took his leave, the only sober one among them. One of his hosts was blind drunk, the other, asleep. These past two years, the ample resources of the Tamiya house, even if not at his personal disposal, had provided him with the chance to toughen up and he took advantage of it.</p>
<p>Iemon was by no means as confident as he pretended to be in the presence of Kaiho. He had been a monk, but a change of surroundings has a way of changing people. Prior experience notwithstanding, there was always a possibility…. As he made his way slowly through Tera-machi, his thoughts wandered into the events of the recent past.</p>
<p>“The bond that joined me with Iwa was evil,” he thought to himself. “Most certainly she has drowned herself in the canal. The body must be found and given a proper burial. Memorial services are to be recited to appease the spirit of those who died alone, without relatives or friends.”</p>
<p>His pious resolve grew out of a pensive mood prompted by the sight of the temple graveyards that lined the street along which he walked. It was a beautiful street, with overhanging trees, open plots of land inhabited by hosts of the dead, and temples adorned in gorgeous red and gold set among the dark green of the pines and cedars. He quickened his pace at the threat of rain. Gusts of wind crisscrossed his path, driving the first drops of the impending storm. He reached home just as it broke in all its fury.</p>
<p>He would say nothing to Hana of his meeting with Kaiho. When she remarked on the lateness of the hour, he replied that the old man had been out of sorts and that Kihei was too energetic a drinking companion for someone who had nearly reached his seventieth year. Despite his vigorous appearances, Iemon explained, saké had begun to take its toll on his ageing body. </p>
<p>The two prepared for bed. Hana listened as the rain beat against the shutters, wave after wave as if it where trying to get in. She snickered.</p>
<p>“Who would have thought it!”</p>
<p>“Thought what?” snapped Iemon, his nerves still a bit frayed from his visit with Kaiho. Hana laughed.</p>
<p>“That you and I would be where we are now. We parted ways on a night like this. The sight of you weeping would have driven me into a cave forever, had it not been for a stroke of luck, the drunken constable among the guests who gave me the opportunity to warn you…. And now, together again, we live in luxury. My every wish has come true. Thanks to the past for carrying our meeting in its womb! Thanks to the present for securing our happiness! </p>
<p>“Lost along the way </p>
<p>Once again our footpaths cross </p>
<p>A hill of flowers blooms.”</p>
<p>A blast of wing struck against the shutters, which bent and cracked at the force of the gale. A white flash of lightning revealed that one of the rain-doors had come loose from its rail. Iemon arose to put it back. As he turned around, the room was suddenly plunged in darkness.</p>
<p>“The lantern has gone out,” said Hana. “But look! The candles on the family altar are lit, but I had extinguished them.”</p>
<p>Iemon grumbled. “The wind blew out the lamp. And as for the altar candles, the wicks were probably smoldering and all it took was a breath of wind to reignite them. Fire is not to be taken lightly. One needs to be extra careful in putting out the candles.”</p>
<p>He reignited the flame in the lamp and Hana went over to the altar to blow out the candles. She reached out to pick up one of them and let out a piercing cry as she fell backwards in shock and confusion.</p>
<p>“There’s a rat snake in the altar! Help, help me!”</p>
<p>When she turned to run, the snake dropped with a thud onto the tatami, uncoiled to its full six feet in length, and slunk ahead after her. Iemon came up behind it and caught it up by the tail. He gave a sharp rap to the back of its head, stunning it. It hung limp in his hand.</p>
<p>“Hana, open the rain shutters.”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t move. I won’t move.”</p>
<p>“What a coward!” said Iemon. “The time will come, in some future life, when you are forced to slither around the hills and valleys in this very form.”</p>
<p>“Stop it!” </p>
<p>Hana was dumfounded at his words, which stung her like a cruel and evil curse.</p>
<p>“Has my life been so wicked as to as to deserve such punishment in a future life? It cannot be the monk of Reigan who speaks, nor can it be my Iemon.” </p>
<p>She watched his lips move as he stood at the shutters but could not make out what he was saying.</p>
<p>“The bond between Hana and me is evil. Do not roam the earth as an unattended spirit but become a buddha and enter at once into nirvana. Namu myōhō renge kyō. All praise to the Buddha, to the wondrous Dharma, to the Holy Scripture.”</p>
<p>Chanting the invocation, Iemon cast the serpent far out into the garden and returned to where Hana was waiting.</p>
<p>“That was a blue general, the most harmless of snakes. Farmers keep them around to take care of the rats that infest homes and storehouses. How can you be afraid of snakes when you live in a house like this overgrown with weeds and grass from the roof to the garden?”</p>
<p>Hana’s reply was indirect.</p>
<p>“It’s bad luck to hold a snake in your hands.”</p>
<p>“Enough of that. This is a priest, who knows all about snakes, talking. Go to sleep now.”</p>
<p>She obeyed, having learned nothing of Iwa and the events of the day. She spent the night tossing and turning in interrupted sleep. By morning she had a high fever.</p>
<p>17 News about Kaiho</p>
<p>The word was that Kaiho was ill, very ill. Friends and family who came to call on him spoke of his condition with fear and trembling. To understand what follows, it is best to know something more of this man and his past. An actor on the stage can assume that their audience is familiar with the general outlines of the story and can pass over such matters with a sentence or two, perhaps with only the allusion of a spine-chilling gesture. Not so the storyteller, who is under obligation to supply the reader with a minutia of detail.</p>
<p>Itō Kaiho did not boast when he spoke of his beauty as a boy or of the handsome figure he cut as a young man. These things had earned him wealth and status, or so it was whispered, through depraved service to his lord. At the time he had an assistant named Isuke. Kaiho sat before the mirror engaged in applying the creams and powders which had become necessary of late to make him fit to stand in the presence of his lord. He grimaced uncomfortably and turned toward his assistant with irritation.</p>
<p>“Isuke, you’re a clever fellow. Up until a few days ago, I didn’t need any makeup to improve my appearance. And now, not even the whole armory of a woman’s cosmetics or all the creams and powders of an actor are enough to hide the blotches that disfigure my face and body. My voice has become broken and husky; I feel sharp pains in my limbs and joints; there are patches of black and blue. I’m in such a state that soon it will be impossible for me to hold the post of chief attendant in his lordship’s household service. What disorder is this that eats away at my life and happiness?”</p>
<p>At first Isuke made no attempt to answer, other than a bow to acknowledge his master’s remark on his intelligence, a matter on which he was in full agreement. He seemed engaged in a close examination of the end of Kaiho’s nose. “Hmmm, hmmm.” That was all that Kaiho could get out of him for the moment. Isuke could see the anger building up inside and finally found his words.</p>
<p>“Before I begin, I must beg your pardon. Much as I regret having to incur the anger of my young lord, a faithful servant is obliged to speak. Kindly step this way.”</p>
<p>He led Kaiho to a small adjoining room that opened on one of those inner gardens it was usual to find in properly constructed houses of any size at the time. He closed the rain shutters, cutting off the light from the outside. Then he fetched a piece of camphor and lit it. Once it had taken fire and flared into a thick yellow light, he took a hand mirror and passed it to Kaiho. The young lord was frightened at what he saw: his face was as dark as a Satsuma peasant.</p>
<p>“The darkness,” said Isuke, “becomes visible under the light of the burning camphor. The color is due to poison circulating between the body and the outer skin. It does not show up in ordinary sunlight. But there is another test.”</p>
<p>He lit a candle and held a long steel hairpin over the flame until it became red-hot. He held the cold end with his headband and gripped Kaiho’s arm. The young man drew back, afraid.</p>
<p>“No, there will be no pain,” Isuke reassured him and thrust the heated end several inches under the skin. And indeed, as far as Kaiho could feel, the needle might as well have been thrust into the tatami mats at his at his feet. Isuke withdrew the needle and carefully squeezed the arm. A brownish liquid oozed out. Whatever it was, it wasn’t blood.</p>
<p>“The master has a nose—at least for now.” </p>
<p>Kaiho lifted his arm to his nostrils and quickly turned his face aside in disgust and shock.</p>
<p>“Am I already dead and rotting? Look at me— all is lost. How can I carry out my duties any longer? And if I can’t, Isuke, my income will dry up. There’s nothing left to do but ready the mats and swords for seppuku.”</p>
<p>Isuke examined him scrupulously. Satisfied with his analysis, he spoke.</p>
<p>“Trust me. Before I was an attendant, I was the son of doctor practicing Dutch medicine in Nagasaki. That is, until gambling, saké, and women reduced me to a servant’s state. My family and friends have long since cut themselves off from me. I was formally disowned by my parents. I have no other obligations now than to my master, Kaiho. My refuge is here with you. Now if you are willing to part with a mere three silver ryō, your disease is curable. Leave it to me. A proper dose of mercury will remove the poison and all the appalling symptoms that go with it. Your service will continue, the two hundred and thirty bundles of rice you enjoy as an income will be safe, and I get to keep my good master.”</p>
<p>Flattered and yet frightened, Kaiho handed over the money at once. Isuke withdrew to procure the drug called for by Dutch medicine. Baths and potions, potions and baths, followed; and in due course, Isuke’s predictions were fulfilled. The disgusting symptoms were gradually alleviated. Inside of six months, Kaiho was himself again and his position was assured. He sighed deeply twice, once in relief from the nightmare that had haunted him, and once in anxiety for the nightmare that had taken its place.</p>
<p>Kaiho was a lecher and a gambler. So was Isuke. Not long after the cure had taken effect and the income of two hundred and thirty sacks of rice had been secured for the two of them, Isuke disappeared. Kaiho was relieved at the departure of one who knew too much of his affairs, but at the same time the thought of losing the only “doctor” in whom he had confidence troubled him.</p>
<p>“Their kind come and go,” Kaiho said to himself, “like leaves on a tree. Isuke got tired and deserted his post. Perhaps some day he will return. I am a good master.”</p>
<p>Isuke did in fact return—with a note from the licensed quarters of Yoshiwara regarding twenty ryō owed to cover gambling debts and entertainment expenses. Isuke stood there, eyes opened in astonishment, as Kaiho reprimanded him.</p>
<p>“With all due respect, I understand. But a reduction in your income does not affect my share. I live well within my means.”</p>
<p>This was the first intimation Kaiho had of how Isuke viewed his role as a physician. In those days, doctors were more gratified by practicing their art than being paid for it. What is more, with prominent patients—like Kaiho—doctors kept a modest distance. Even a pulse was taken from the vibration of a string attached to the patient’s wrist, or at least by a hand passed under a blanket.</p>
<p>For a time, Kaiho’s curious physician devoted himself to the more prosaic duties of an attendant. Within ten days, Kaiho had to ransom him from a haunt in Shinagawa for the price of ten ryō. A few weeks later, a notice arrived from a gambler’s nest in Shinjuku: an unconditional demand for fifty ryō. Kaiho had lost all patience. As it happens, he held an office that allowed him to bring the matter to a close. He needed to have Isuke around, in Yotsuya. As usual, covering the debt left Isuke repentant, gushing with promises to make amends. </p>
<p>Kaiho smiled and spoke in a soft voice. Shortly thereafter, Isuke was sent to jail on a trumped up charge of having robbed a fellow attendant. As magistrate for the district, Kaiho was in full control. When word reached him, he assured Isuke of a speedy release. In his displeasure, he had him served poisoned food after going without eating for some time. Isuke died furious and cursing his master. No one could hear his cries save his two jailers, who knew of his bad record and thought him delirious.</p>
<p>The years passed, but Isuke’s memory remained dormant in the back of Kaiho’s mind. Then came the Tamiya affair and Iwa’s direful curse. Iemon’s reassurances only lasted through the night. In the sober light of the morning it was clear that Kaiho’s nerves were frazzled and his imagination had gone wild. He inflicted his sleepless nights on his friends with an increasing irritability. The first few days he seemed to take everything comically. He was hesitant to speak freely of Iwa, and when he did, he joked about expecting her to reappear. Then he took to playing tricks, jumping out of the shadows or a turn in the hallway to startle the maids. Although not entirely surprised, as Kaiho was given to terrorize the female side of the household, they grew alarmed at these latest manifestations. There was something wild and unnatural about the old man amusing himself at their expense. By now, he talked of nothing but Iwa. His hysterical mirth had passed over to an hysterical fear. Afraid that Lady Tamiya would visit him in his sleep, he stayed awake through the night. He was terrified of being alone and had others keep him company. His speech had become gibberish.</p>
<p>“We will make nighttime in this house into day. You can sleep in the daytime. Lights! Lights! More lights!”</p>
<p>And there he sat, surrounded by his household, until the dim light of dawn broke through the cracks above the rain shutters. One of the women who had let her hair down to wash it, came up to him unexpectedly in the hallway. He let out a frightened howl and started to run, until he recognized her. He threw himself on her in a demented rage and beat her to a pulp. People around the ward began to gossip about the eccentricities of their constable Itō Kaiho.</p>
<p>Barely three weeks after Iemon’s visit, a violent scene broke out in the Kaiho residence. There was a great ruckus in Kaiho’s room with shouting and screaming and the smashing of sliding screens. Kihei, who preferred to sleep at night like the other men in the house, rushed in to find the old man standing alone and stark naked. The last of the woman servants had fled the room as he danced about from side to side, waving about his short pillow sword.</p>
<p>“Isuke! Iwa! Forgive me my wickedness! I poisoned Isuke’s food. I sold Iwa to whore on the streets. And they will haunt me through seven births and rebirths. Let the chase begin! But I don’t deal with night-hawks; my stakes are higher. Begone, wench!” </p>
<p>Realizing he was no longer alone, he picked up a flower vase from the alcove and threw it in the direction of the intruder. Kihei dodged the missile and caught Kaiho in a wrestling hold, throwing him to the ground. At that very moment Kakusuke entered the room, only to be knocked flat on his back by the heavy vase. He groaned in pain as he got up to join the other servants who had come to assist Isuke. In no time, Kaiho was overpowered and kept under watch for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>By the time daylight came around, Kaiho had no recollection of what had occurred. At least he did not refer to it or respond to the chatter going on around him. Fear had hit him full on. He ranted on and on about Isuke and Iwa. Clearly he was ill, downright incapacitated. There would be no more turning of day into night and night into day. He was now in the hands of his nurses. But Kihei marshalled the women to humor his delusions. They placed their beds in a circle with Kaiho’s in the middle. Kihei and Kakusuke stayed with them as well. Together they lay in the brightly lit room, adorned with scores of lanterns and candles blazing on lamp stands. Sutra scrolls were placed along the sides and in each corner. Try as he might, the sleep Kaiho so desperately sought eluded him.</p>
<p>“There’s a sound coming from the hallway…. Namu Amida Butsu! Buddha grant me refuge!… Kihei, Kihei!” </p>
<p>He was sure his cries would reach Kihei more quickly than they would the Buddha. Indeed, there was a sound, like hair brushing against the paper screens, as if someone—or something—were trying to peek through the cloth-like material. There was a rattle and a dash of rain. A burst of wind swept through the hallway and the paper screens parted slightly. Kaiho gave a shriek.</p>
<p>“Iwa! Iwa! The bloated face, the drooping eyelids, the stench of a corpse in the air—aah, it has me by the throat. The obake is trying to wrest me from among the living. Ooooh!”</p>
<p>A stronger gust of wind dislodged the sliding screen from its rails, sending it in a spin and crashing into the room. Terror incited courage in the sick old man and he charged frantically ahead. The emboldening of this flabby and emaciated wreck of a man into a raving, fear-inspiring maniac was a ghastly sight to behold. The women huddled and crouched in fear. The room was now dim except for a single lantern near the alcove. Had Kaiho gone mad? As the men fell over each other trying to gather up the pieces of the broken screen in the darkness of the hallway, the women became aware of a presence, at first like a faint mist and then gradually more distinct. Standing there over the men in a long black robe, her wide, bloated face glowing with a greenish tint, her hair in wild disarray, her bulging forehead and swollen eyelids and empty sockets in clear relief, it was none other than Iwa. A severed head hung at her side. Abruptly she thrust it into Kaiho’s face, leering at him cruelly as she did so. He fell flat on his back screaming. The braver of the men entered with candles and slowly the others gathered around the figure lying unconscious on the floor.</p>
<p>Kaiho’s condition became critical. His former infirmity, long dormant, returned to assault him with its full force. The mental symptoms may have been only a first indication of what was to come. The ulcers that broke out all over his body were by far the greater affliction. The itching nearly drove him delirious. The more he scratched, the more his sores spread. They turned into boils, running with pus. The stench was so unbearable that hardly anyone could stand being near him. The women fled the room in horror at the sight of the river of decay gushing out of him, not to mention the unbroken train of lewd depravities issuing from his corroded mind. Their absence was not lost on him. Only Kihei, along with the stalwart and faithful Kakusuke, remained to look after him. Then one day, without warning, Kaiho made a request.</p>
<p>“Hana, the harlot of Reigan. I want to talk to her and amuse myself with her. Bring her here. And bring some saké and a shamisen for a proper feast. Hana, Hana!”</p>
<p>He was so insistent that finally Kihei thought her presence might quiet him. A request was sent to the house of Iemon. Hoping to keep her from learning what had happened to Iwa, Iemon had said nothing. He tried to refuse the invitation on the pretext of a running quarrel with Kaiho and Kihei, but Hana was unexpectedly obstinate.</p>
<p>“You owe it to me to show my gratitude to Kaiho. I have my obligations to the past as well as to the present.”</p>
<p>She snarled and knit her brow. Iemon shrank back. He put a hand up to cover the eyes into which he had just felt Iwa peering. He dropped his objections and agreed to let her to go.</p>
<p>Hana was still weak from repeated attacks of the fever that began the night Iemon drove out the rat snake. She said the snake had bitten her and that it was the poison, and not the fever, that was making her ill. Iemon laughed at her when she suggested he perform a priest’s exorcism. There was more at play than the irritation she felt at her husband’s scepticism. Behind it lay the curious clinging of a woman to a former lover, someone from the past with whom she had been intimate. In her heart, Hana harbored a strong attraction for the man who had rescued her from the fast pace and nauseating life of the Fukagawa brothel where she was cast into the arms of whoever pointed at her and was prepared to pay. Had things not changed, in time she would likely have been as unfaithful to Iemon as she had been to Kaiho. She would have answered the call of Kaiho’s desire and overcome the temporary repugnance she felt for him even before he had become a swollen mass of flesh consumed with disease. But now, as she leaned over him, all but overcome by the stench, she spoke in endearing terms in an attempt to rouse him to consciousness and get him to recognize her. The thought of his dying without saying farewell upset her. Kihei helped by sitting the old man up. There was an unsettling look of terror in his eyes, now enlarged by fever and delirium. He gazed at her for some time.</p>
<p>“It is me, Hana. Hana, your onetime lover. Take heart. Your afflictions will pass. With me here to nurse you back to health, your recovery is assured.”</p>
<p>She laid her hands on his shoulders and as she did so, her hair fell loose about her ashen face. Kaiho was petrified. With a shrill cry the old man pushed her away violently.</p>
<p>“You, you rawboned wench! How dare you show your face here! Every last moment, in my waking hours and in my dreams, she hounds me. I sold you, it’s true. I sold you into service as a night-hawk to Tōemon of Honjo. Do you think I’d consort with such a woman?”</p>
<p>He raised his fists and began shouting as he pounded on her.</p>
<p>“It’s Iwa, it’s Iwa! The obake is after me. She’s broken out of hell and the waters of the Warigesui to snatch me away. Help! Somebody help me! Get the obake away from me!”</p>
<p>The old man was in another of his fits of delirium. Kakusuke answered Kihei’s shouts and the two of them disentangled Kaiho’s hands from Hana’s hair. The wounds on her face were not as deep as those he had inflicted on her mind. At last the secret was out. She fled barefoot along the muddy streets leading back to the Samon-chō house.</p>
<p>The hideousness of Kaiho’s disease and the vileness of his tongue had already driven the women to the remotest quarters of the house, as far away as possible from the room in which he was laid up. But what little service they continued to perform faced another obstacle: they were all agreed his room was haunted.</p>
<p>Out of necessity, one of the maids had brought in the required medications. Setting her lamp down in the hallway, she pushed open the sliding screens to enter the outer chamber, and as she did, caught her robe. She stepped back to pull it free and then let out a chilling scream. Standing in the hallway, at the open screen behind her, were two tall figures robed in black. Dishevelled hair draped their broad and flat white faces, brows bulging and eyelids swollen. The empty sockets without eyes looked right through the woman and into the room. One of the creatures, the more hideous of the two with her drooping lids and half-bald head, moved ahead as if falling toward the frightened maid. Sounds of wild laughter mingled with the maid’s shrill cries. Kihei came rushing in, sword drawn, to find her hysterical. Piecing together her broken phrases as best he could, he stepped out into the hallway. There was no one there. A kimono and covering jacket hung there to dry rustled calmly in the draft. Is this what had frightened the woman? Kakusuke brought her back to her companions. After that, no one would dare enter the part of the building where Kaiho was confined. His son Kihei and his longtime faithful attendant Kakusuke saw to his needs on their own.</p>
<p>Kihei contemplated the old man’s sickly face. “Father, why the wrinkles on your forehead? Has the pain returned?”</p>
<p>“It’s the rats. I am unnerved by their constant gnawing.”</p>
<p>“Rats?” replied Kihei in some astonishment. He looked around. The sliding screens were closed tight. Kaiho watched his son and shook his head, pointing to the paper-covered transom near the ceiling. There was no way to keep them from getting in up there.</p>
<p>“Auntie is old and deaf. When she is asleep, the rats go after the infant in the cradle, attracted by the foul sores that cover the repugnant child. The child grows thinner and weaker by the day until at last it dies. The rat is a terrible creature.”</p>
<p>On the off-chance that there was something to these ravings, Kihei went to fetch a mosquito net and weighted down its perimeter with heavy stones. This way, those keeping watch would not be caught by surprise and the ailing patient would be left in peace.</p>
<p>“His illness is becoming tedious,” Kihei reflected. “Perhaps I should head over to Yoshiwara for a spell. The letters from the beauties there are beginning to pile up. There is nothing more I can do here and I have run out of excuses for not going. What do you think, Kakusuke?”</p>
<p>Kakusuke was brave and he knew that Kihei was, too. But the prospect of facing another one of his former master’s tantrums alone, not to mention facing Iwa, did not appeal to him. He offered his advice.</p>
<p>“The old man is in a most precarious state. He is so very weak, the worst may happen at any moment. For you to be enjoying yourself at such a time in the licensed quarters would arouse criticism in the ward—no, a lot more than just criticism. It would be considered disrespectful to your father. You need to rethink that idea.”</p>
<p>Kihei looked sourly at the swollen mass of decay lying there.</p>
<p>“How does he still hold on? His strength must be extraordinary.”</p>
<p>Kakusuke just shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“He won’t die easily. He’s got a good deal more to go through.”</p>
<p>“By all the gods and buddhas, how did he come to such an end? It’s enough to rattle anyone who’s capable of fear.”</p>
<p>Kakusuke looked askance at him. </p>
<p>“This old-timer enjoyed the high life and loved to excess. You’d do well to reconsider.”</p>
<p>The night passed slowly. Worn out by the long vigil at Kaiho’s beck and call, the two of them finally gave up the useless struggle and fell asleep. Kakusuke remained in the room; Kihei had retired to the training hall. The clash of the wooden swords and the shouts of the combatants rang in his ears as the wind and pounding rain shook and tore at the shutters. But it was Kakusuke standing and shouting at the sliding doors that aroused him from his slumber.</p>
<p>“Master, young master! Come at once. And please, hurry.”</p>
<p>Kihei ran into the next room. Kakusuke pointed, terror-stricken, to the mosquito net. Beneath it a figure stood upright, swaying back and forth, waving its arms, scuffling—a horrendous figure all in black.</p>
<p>“Unh!” Kaiho grunted. The only reply was a grinding, munching sound.</p>
<p>“Hold on, father. I’m here.”</p>
<p>Kihei rushed over to the heavy stones and tossed them aside so he could enter under the net. All at once, the swaying figure collapsed to the floor in a heap. Kihei tore at the netting and cut through it with his sword. A black huddle of rats scampered off in every which direction. As he approached his father, Kihei’s eyes met with a grisly sight. Kaiho’s eyes and ears, his nose, his chin, his toes and fingers had been eaten off his body. His lips had been gnawed away, leaving the grin of his teeth exposed. One last feeble groan and Kaiho met his end. </p>
<p>Neither Kihei nor Kakusuke dared to even touch the gruesome corpse. They just looked at each other in panic.</p>
<p>Kihei fell to his knees. “Namu Amida Butsu! Amida Buddha, preserve us!” he prayed. “Namu Amida Butsu!” echoed Kakusuke.</p>
<p>18 In the Shadow of the Old-Timer</p>
<p>The following day, one of the neighbors met up with a fellow-gossip. </p>
<p>“Ah! Goemon, is it? I hear the old-timer is to be congratulated.” </p>
<p>Kamimura Goemon sniffed. He cut a lanky figure, with a long face, a long nose, and long, thin arms and legs. He was a nasty man, who liked nothing better than to give advice to others that they disliked hearing and watch them squirm uncomfortably. In fact, this paradigm of longitude rarely spoke in good faith or temper.</p>
<p>“The old-timer congratulated? He may have escaped the troubles of this world, but worse may be awaiting him in the next.”</p>
<p>Mizoguchi Hanbei was taken aback at the unexpected reply. Goe­mon went on to explain.</p>
<p>“You see, the old-timer died a leper’s death, eaten alive by the rats. Such an end hardly calls for congratulations.”</p>
<p>Mizoguchi gasped, his rounded eyes accentuating his plump face. “Extraordinary!”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” replied Kamikura, complacently tapping the palm of one hand with the bony fingers of the other.</p>
<p>“The old fellow drove Iwa out of the Tamiya house and in her place gave Hana to Iemon. Hana, the harlot, mind you! Iwa cursed him just before she died, and thus he came to his unspeakable end. Akiyama, Natsume, and Imaizumi will surely follow, as will anyone else involved in the affair.”</p>
<p>“But are you sure Iwa was the cause of the death? He did not take very good care of his health when he was alive.”</p>
<p>A third person had stepped into the conversation, but Kamimura silenced him with a scowl.</p>
<p>“Of course it was Iwa. Did they not recognize her? The women of the house were witnesses. Only Kihei, the inveterate skeptic, and Kakusuke, who would stand up to the devil in person, pretend to deny it.”</p>
<p>He waved a hand in a display of righteousness. </p>
<p>“But it does inspire fear in one. Wickedness and ill-will are of little profit in the end. ‘Tis a fool who indulges in either…. It’s cold for this time of the year!”</p>
<p>“Still and all, condolences are in order,” the interloper insisted. “We have to attend the wake. What a bother. Iwa might not even show up. Isn’t there any way to get out of it?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not,” Kamimura scolded. “The old-timer was the head of the ward association. Twelve neighbors have been invited to the all-night vigil, and at dawn the body is to be prepared for burial. If what people say is true, it should be pleasant enough. The food will be top quality and plentiful, as will the saké. No one should miss it.”</p>
<p>He smacked his lips and others followed suit, though less enthusiastically.</p>
<p>It was an unwilling band of laggards that crawled in procession through the rain and mud the length of Tera-machi and all the way to Kaiho’s house. The residence was a splendid symbol of a constable, a ward head, and a man of wealth. The atmosphere, on the contrary, was oppressive. Kihei greeted the guests cordially and accepted their condolences and gifts with an overflow of gratitude and the cheerful disposition of one who was making a profit from the funeral.</p>
<p>Kakusuke was his main assistant at what was to be Kaiho’s final appearance. A timid, pale-faced woman was also seen at the festivities from time to time, only to slip away quickly to seek out her panic-stricken companions. Inside the funereal chamber the body had been laid out and suitably swathed to cover up the ghastly nature of Kaiho’s death as far as possible. A white wooden funeral tablet was placed on a stand with a questionable inscription lauding the qualities of the deceased: “A great man of heavenly virtues, upright heart, and benevolent temperament.” A folding screen of carp fighting their way upstream was turned upside down and placed at the head of the body.</p>
<p>Lo, the folding screen:</p>
<p>Carried by the waterfall,</p>
<p>Carp run now downstream.</p>
<p>Akiyama, Natsume, and Imaizumi, were the last to show up. Akiyama was trying to mediate a violent quarrel that had broken out between the other two, the skinny one and the fat one. Accusations were flying and the usually even-tempered Imaizumi was greatly agitated and in an altogether bad mood. He glowered spitefully at Natsume, who now joined forces with Akiyama in trying to calm him down. By the time they joined the gathering, they had all regained their composure. Natsume was the first to speak.</p>
<p>“The past has a way of catching up with all of us. He was old, but oh so vigorous. Please accept this simple token of my condolence. I should like now to burn a stick of incense in his memory.”</p>
<p>Kihei expressed his gratitude, doing his best to suppress a smile. For the first time in weeks he was able to breathe freely. The storm had passed and good fortune lay on the horizon. The sky was cloudy but serene.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I am blessed, and more than that, I am in your debt. I shall never forget your kindness.”</p>
<p>A voice from somewhere in the room interrupted.</p>
<p>“The soul of the old-timer has departed. Why are Iemon and Hana not here?”</p>
<p>“Hana is quite ill,” Akiyama spoke up in their defense. “She is in a bad way and Iemon cannot leave her alone.”</p>
<p>Kihei’s joy was complete.</p>
<p>Akiyama, Natsume, and Imaizumi were standing over Kaiho’s body when Kamimura slowly made his way over to them. His long face seemed longer than usual—much longer than Natsume’s, and Kihei’s wasn’t even in the running. He fondled his nose pensively, pretending to be deep in thought when all he wanted was a bit of relief from the odor emanating from Kaiho’s bier. It was no bed of roses.</p>
<p>” Yes, the old fellow really is dead.” He sniffed. “Soon it will be all of your turns to end up like this.” He sniffed again. “For Iemon and Hana, for Natsume and Imaizumi, and for Akiyama here.”</p>
<p>Akiyama was dumfounded. He, too, held a hand to his nose as he glared at the intruder, who had still more to say.</p>
<p>“A plot was concocted against Iwa. She was left penniless and driven from the ward, only to be betrayed again and sold as a street harlot. The old-timer’s death is only the first step of her revenge. I’m telling you honestly and without malice: you men are not long for this world. Have you resigned yourself to that, Akiyama?”</p>
<p>He pointed a bony finger at Natsume and then at Imaizumi.</p>
<p>“The signs have already begun: hollow eyes, limp nostrils, an ashen face. You almost look like corpses fit to be laid out alongside the old-timer.”</p>
<p>Akiyama found his tongue and flew into a rage.</p>
<p>“Your humor is out of place. You’ve gone too far this time, Kamimura. It’s true I gave advice to Kaiho. And my companions here, they also had some part to play in what followed. But we were acting on the orders of Itō and Iemon. If there is any score to be settled, it should start with Itō.”</p>
<p>Kamimura laughed callously and gestured toward the corpse.</p>
<p>“Here he lies. And just how did he get here? I assure you, I am not joking. Your attempt to defend yourselves is atrocious. When the master orders his servants to brush the snow off the bushes, it falls on them, not on him. What have you to say for yourself now?”</p>
<p>Akiyama turned his back in humiliation. All three of them were uncomfortable, body and soul.</p>
<p>Directly across the street, the temple bell of Sainen-ji struck one o’clock in the morning. Its clanging echoed throughout the residence like a ghostly wail. In the depths of the night, the dormant mass of metal seemed to come to life, reaching into the hearts of those present and alerting them to the gravity of what faced them. Realizing that Natsume had already left, the round-faced, round-eyed, round-bodied Imaizumi took off after him. Kihei exited the dining room to find that all his guests had flown.</p>
<p>“Where have they gone, Kakusuke?” He looked around in bewilderment.</p>
<p>“They excused themselves with stomach aches. Something is going around Yotsuya.”</p>
<p>The attendant spoke in the dry and confident tone of someone unconvinced by his own words. Kihei shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“So there’s is nothing wrong with the food or saké?”</p>
<p>“No, and not with the guests either,” replied Kakusuke. “They’re just cowards who got a whiff of the old man’s far from pleasant end.”</p>
<p>“Fighting men nowadays are not what they once were, at least not this breed. Wretched little bureaucrats—they’re warriors in pen only. And the two of us are left with enough supper to feed twelve starving yardmen. Well, at least two are enough to wash the corpse. Give me a hand, Kakusuke.”</p>
<p>“Your wish is my command,” replied the attendant.</p>
<p>The outer white robe that was to cover the body lay ready at hand. Kaiho had procured it many years previously on a pilgrimage to the holy site of Mt Kōya. A sacred text had been woven into the delicate cloth. Kakusuke dragged a large tub into the bathroom. Once the layers of clothing had been removed, the body was placed inside. Kakusuke contemplated his late master with a critical and disapproving eye.</p>
<p>“Indeed, the old-timer is a strange thing to behold. No eyes or nose or ears or lips. His expression so repulsive.… Stop! You’re doing it wrong. The water should be thrown from head to feet.… Watch out! You’re getting me, too, and I’m still alive. You’re wasting water, and now we’re run out. Wait a minute while I draw more from the well.”</p>
<p>He opened the side door and went outside. Kihei took a step back from the body. The stench was disgusting. A sharp noise at the skylight made him look up. Horror of horrors! There in the opening was the round, white, flat face of Iwa with its puffy eyelids and a sightless scowl. Kihei ran for the door screaming in shock and panic. A pair of long, tapered arms groped their way downward.</p>
<p>“Kakusuke, Kakusuke!”</p>
<p>“What is it, my young master?”</p>
<p>“It’s Iwa. She’s looking down from the skylight. She’s after the old man.”</p>
<p>Kakusuke look upward. “Nonsense, it’s only the cat. Are your nerves getting frazzled, too? You shouldn’t trust them too much.”</p>
<p>“The cat…?” Kihei let out a sigh of relief but kept a hand on his sword.</p>
<p>He turned round and another shock awaited him.</p>
<p>“Kakusuke! The body–it’s gone!”</p>
<p>Startled, the attendant came running and peered into the empty tub. What the two of them saw next nearly knocked them over. The body of the old-timer was whirling around in the adjoining room like a raving maniac. Together with Kakusuke, the upstanding son and heir gave chase. As if guided by invisible hands, Kaiho and his pursuers were led out into the pounding rain and the dark of the garden. Kihei heard steps just in front of him. He bolted frenziedly after them.</p>
<p>It is written, “It is an offense against all the rules of samurai chivalry to lose the body of a parent.” Kihei would be forgiven every sort of moral and physical atrocity except one. The sacred texts of the warrior code make it clear that to fail in one’s duties as a son to his father is an unforgiveable sin. </p>
<p>Soon Kakusuke had lost sight of his master in the darkness. Anxious and upset, he returned to fetch a lantern. The wind promptly blew out the flame. Then a second time, and a third. He stood in the dim light of the hallway to await Kihei’s return. He began to wonder if his master had lost his way. Was he not more disturbed over this than at the eerie disappearance of Kaiho’s body? Had the young master lost his nerve like his father before him?</p>
<p>After some time Kihei reappeared. He could read the quizzical look on Kakusuke’s face and quickly explained.</p>
<p>“I chased the old man all the way to the Myōgyō-ji temple and then up the hill, where I lost track of him. It was too dark to search any further. Lanterns are next to worthless in a gale like this. Natsume and Imaizumi live nearby. They are young, and if you ask them, they might help me in the search.”</p>
<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Kakusuke drew his cape over his head and headed out. His only concern was the missing body. Whether Iwa happened to be involved or not did not matter to an iron-heart like him. But it was all in vain. The two men had left with the intention of spending the night at the Kaiho wake and neither of them had returned as yet. Kihei grumbled at the news.</p>
<p>“The filthy brutes! To foist an excuse like that on their wives while they scamper off to greener pastures in Naka-chō and spend the night in promiscuity. Natsume is an unrepentant leech who would only be too happy to wean Imaizumi from his newly-wed wife.”</p>
<p>“Or seduce her away for himself. Master, there is nothing more we can do now. We can only wait for the sun to come up.”</p>
<p>With that sage advice, Kakusuke sat down as a respectful distance from Kihei. From time to time one or other of them got up to look sceptically into the empty tub that had once held the old-timer’s body. At long last they nodded off to sleep. They were awakened at dawn by a loud thumping noise at the outer gate. Kakusuke went out to see and returned with a look of shock and some ominous news. The dead bodies of Natsume Kyūzō and Imaizumi Jinzaemon had been discovered at the foot of the haunted ginkgo tree near the guardhouse. It was a massive tree, whose girth was that of more than three man with their arms outstretched could encircle. Alongside the bodies of the men lay that of a woman, all three of them stark naked.</p>
<p>As successor to his father’s duties as magistrate, Kihei’s presence was required. He made preparations immediately to leave for the city gates in the ward. In time, further details were provided by the talkative Kamimura Goemon, who had witnessed at least part at of what had transpired. He had just returned from Kaiho’s wake and was standing at the door to his house on the Shinjuku road when he heard someone running in the street. It was Kyūzō, charging ahead at full speed and dragging a woman by the hand, whom he recognized as Imaizumi’s wife. The were wearing almost nothing. Imaizumi Jinzaemon followed in close pursuit, sword unsheathed. Up the wide road they raced. Goemon stepped out into the street and tagged along to observe chase from a safe distance. The fugitives were overtaken at the haunted ginkgo. The woman was the first to be cut down. Kyūzō turned to defend himself against his assailant, but he was unarmed and his fate soon caught up with him. He fell to the ground, slashed across the chest. Having finished with his victims, Imaizumi seated himself at the foot of the tree and cut open his own belly. </p>
<p>“For some time now I’d been expecting something like this to happen,” the long-nose concluded.</p>
<p>There was nothing left to explain. Others stepped in to echo the verdict of Goemon, who was several fathoms deeper into neighborhood scandals than most of them. It was agreed to hush the matter up. After recounting his own experiences of the night to the astonishment of his listeners, Kihei took Kakusuke and started down Tera-machi toward Samegabashi Bridge. As they passed the Kenshō-ji temple, they noticed a pack of dogs fighting in the cemetery over what appeared to be a white object. The two men sprang ahead shouting. Kihei picked up a wooden tablet from one of the graves and rushed at the dogs to drive them off. The body of the old-timer lay on the ground, left there by Iwa to be mangled and torn to pieces by the teeth of savage strays.</p>
<p>And so it came to be that funeral rites for Itō Kaiho, Natsume Kyūzō, and Imaizumi Jinzaemon took place one after the other on the same day and at the same hour. Could something providential have been at work in the postponement of the old-timer’s funeral?</p>
<p>19 Tamiya Yoemon, Kondō, and Myōzen</p>
<p>Tamiya Yoemon was tripping over himself in a rush to return home from the funeral of Itō Kaiho. He was bursting with news for his wife Kame. The neighbors could talk of nothing else but the strange events taking place in the ward. No details were lost in the telling; if anything they increased. The most edifying reports had to do with the behavior of the wife of the late Natsume Kyūzō. She was the most observed by all the observers at the funeral. Friends, neighbors, and relatives were openly enthusiastic in their congratulations and at the same time secretly relieved for having been liberated from a prospective burden. </p>
<p>When Natsume died, he left behind a wife, an ageing mother, an infant child, and enormous debts. To manage this legacy—and perhaps get rid of her mother-in-law in the process—his wife decided quickly and with great sadness to renounce her status and sell herself for a period of some years to the master of the Sagamiya, a brothel in Shinagawa. The one hundred ryō she received in exchange would take care of things for the immediate future.</p>
<p>The neighbors, meanwhile, poked fun at the master’s stupidity for agreeing to Akiyama Chōzaemon’s guarantee. If the lady performed badly, the bond to cover his investment would do little to cover his losses. “Ignorance is bliss,” they chortled. Let the Sagamiya bask in the beauty of its prize. Their concern and admiration were reserved for the lady consigned to a post town on the bustling Tōkaidō road, the stopping place of the high and the low, the nobility and the riffraff on their way to Edo. Of all the inhabitants of all the pleasure quarters, the trollops of Shinagawa, Shinjuku, and Itabashi Bridge were held in lowest esteem.</p>
<p>Yoemon called out to his wife from the front door. To his surprise and alarm, there was no answer. He poked his head in but could barely make out anything through the thick smoke that filled the house. The last thing one would do in such a situation was throw open the doors and panels. The whole place would go up in flames in no time. The first thing was to locate the source of the fire. Coughing and gasping for breath, Yoemon groped his way through the rooms to the rear of the house. Wherever the fire started, it was not in the front rooms.</p>
<p>The smoke grew darker as he came to the kitchen. There was an odor of burnt rice. Clearly his supper was being consumed by something other than the gastric juices of Yoemon’s potbelly where it properly belonged. He looked around the room through the deepening haze to where the flames were burning brightest. He could just make out his wife Kame kneeling in front of the portable furnace. She was blowing through a bamboo pipe onto a bundle of twigs and brush to help them catch fire. It was this green and partly wet firewood that was giving off the acrid, choking smoke. Yoemon was beside himself with anger at the sight of what had happened to the dinner he had been looking forward to.</p>
<p>“Kame, Kame! What are you doing? Have you gone mad? Look, dinner is ruined. You must be ill. Your head must be spinning and throbbing. I’ll do the cooking. You go to bed—at once.”</p>
<p>She turned and looked back at Yoemon standing over her. She scowled at his high-handed manner and a shiver of fear ran through him.</p>
<p>“Not a cup of rice, not so much as a mon for me. You would not hesitate to toss a coin to a beggar rather than give any money to Iwa. Then you sold me as a street harlot.”</p>
<p>He jumped back in fear at the twisted, snarling visage before him. Kame sprang to her feet and dumped a hot skillet of stew over the head of her loving husband</p>
<p>“Kame, you’ve gone mad. You’re completely berserk!”</p>
<p>She laughed wildly, and picking up a pot of boiling rice, began to pour it down the drain. When he tried to stop her, she threw the rest of it directly at him.</p>
<p>“Mad? Not at all. I have never felt in better spirits. It’ll be heaven the day you’re pushing up lilies in Samon-chō. Ha ha! The sooner, the better.”</p>
<p>She kicked over the furnace and in an instant the tatami went up in flames. Yoemon fled the house screaming frantically for help. Kame grabbed hold of the burning sticks and began hurling them into this room and that. The younger men of the neighbors rushed past old Yoemon and into the fire. They quickly overpowered the crazed woman and carried her out of the burning building, but were unable to save anything else. They took her to the house of Akiyama Chōzaemon, where she was tied hand and foot and confined to a closet. Old Yoemon stood by helplessly as events unfolded around him. By the time the fire was extinguished, four other houses had been destroyed along with his own. He was ruined and held responsible for everything.</p>
<p>The priest Myōzen had just set foot on the slope leading up from Samegabashi Bridge to Yotsuya. Because he had been occupied with a rather long retreat at the temple of Myōgyō-ji and ceremonies for Nichiren’s birthday, he was unaware of recent events in Yotsuya. He had set out from Kamakura at dawn on April 13th, a particularly beautiful day. Sturdy of frame as he was, the priest was a bit tired and paused to rest at the foot of the hill. His eyes opened wide in astonishment as he saw a funeral procession wending its way down in the late hours of the afternoon. And what a funeral it was! Two men with spears led the way, followed by a long train of attendants bearing three coffins, the first a most imposing casket. Next came the relatives, proceeded by Kihei on horseback. The women rode behind in litters. Myōzen understood at once from the direction and formation that it was a ward funeral. He spied a parishioner in the retinue.</p>
<p>“Kamimura!”</p>
<p>Surprised to see the priest, the lanky, long-faced, long-tongued man broke away from the ranks and greeted his spiritual father obsequiously and with surprise. He was only too happy to loosen his tongue in response to Myōzen’s questions.</p>
<p>“Who is this elaborate funeral ceremony for, you ask? It’s not for one person but for three: Natsume Kyūzō, Imaizumi Jinzaemon, and the ward constable Itō Kaiho. The old-timer is the one who has drawn such an assembly from the ward, along with guards from the city gates and firemen. Natsume and Jinzaemon met a not very edifying end, but the public curiosity surrounding the fate of our former constable was the greater draw. He died a most horrendous death, gnawed and eaten by rats.” </p>
<p>Kamimura proceeded to relate the details of the eventful night.</p>
<p>“Hence the delay in the burial. Natsume and Imaizumi died nearly at the same time. The corpse of the adulterous woman was rejected by both families and cast out into the swamp.”</p>
<p>He took pleasure in the strong impression his tale had made on the priest, who stood there in clerical garb, prayer beads in hand.</p>
<p>“Please join the procession. We can make room for you…”</p>
<p>Kamimura bent down. With the baton he was carrying as leader of his section, he carefully dusted the monk’s robes. He adjusted the folds and stepped back to admire his work.</p>
<p>“The honorable priest is now ready to bury or be buried.”</p>
<p>Myōzen considered the remark to be in bad form. He was about to rebuke him, but curiosity overtook his weary and ill-tempered state. The procession was moving along quickly. He fell into line at once with only a faint acknowledgment of the courtesy shown him as Kamimura hastened forward to his place in line.</p>
<p>A neighbor standing next to the priest offered further explanation. The nature of the deaths of the three men had stirred emotions in the ward. Their roles in the conspiracy against Iwa was now generally known, leaving little doubt that the way they died was an act of revenge on her part. People preferred that they be laid to rest outside the quarter. Their disapproval of Kihei’s response was respectful but emphatic. As a newcomer, he hesitated to behave out of the ordinary and decided to bury them at the Denzu-in, close to the mound honoring the unknown dead who had expired in the great fire of Edo over a half century before. Hence the direction of the procession.</p>
<p>As the funeral procession approached the cemetery of the great temple, Myōzen’s curiosity, which had been simmering morbidly up until then, became overwhelming. He slipped his way through the ranks until he reached the front row at the grave site. He had been a longtime friend and wished for one final glimpse of the departed. A perfunctory prayer was chanted over the graves assigned to Natsume and Imaizumi. The attendants hesitated before lifting the cover from Kaiho’s body. At Myōzen’s gesture they complied. He bent over the coffin and looked in. He froze with horror and yet fascination at the holes, large as teacups, that had once held Kaiho’s eyes and yet somehow seemed to fix on him. The look on the old-timer’s face was unforgettable. The flesh had been ripped off to be chewed on by rats and torn apart by rabid dogs. His mouth had been twisted into a ghastly but strangely lifelike sarcastic grin that conveyed the torments of the hell in which Kaiho had suffered and was suffering still.</p>
<p>The well-practiced pallbearers held their noses and drew back at the stench that arose from the casket, but the priest only leaned in closer. The lips of the decaying old man seemed to move. Was Kaiho trying to say something? Myōzen moved in closer and closer, as if there were still more to be seen. The priest’s poise and determination gave way as the two exchanged greetings. The attendants shouted and leapt in. Myōzen had collapsed in a dead faint and was carried a short distance away and laid on the ground. The Denzu-in monks busied themselves over him. Once he had revived sufficiently, they took him off to the residential quarters of the temple and soon he was able to return home.</p>
<p>“The nosy fool,” Kihei muttered angrily. These days he was on edge and the delay in the funeral rites nearly drove him out of his mind. When would he be done, once and for all, with that old-timer, Kaiho, his father?</p>
<p>That night, Myōzen sat alone in his room, shaken and ashamed at his unseemly curiosity that afternoon. The monks at Denzu-in had regarded him with veiled amusement and disgust. He had caught one of them wiping his lips with his robe. Myōzen put it all down to his exhausted state. They pretended to sympathize with him and when they thought he wasn’t watching, furtively made comical and disgusting gestures. The scene played over and over in his mind now that he was by himself.</p>
<p>“Oh, if only I had not looked. The old-timer’s face was hideous. I cannot put the image out of my mind.”</p>
<p>He glanced at the pages of the sutra lying before him. He skimmed through them, wondering what their cold words about the terrors of death had to do with its reality. It was no use. He couldn’t bring himself to read. Kaiho’s face flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>“The greeting we exchanged! The very idea of making contact with such corruption….”</p>
<p>It was as if he had been plunged into an icy bath. He gave a start. No, it was only the sound of the wind and rain beating against the shutters and making them rattle. He could not sleep. He would watch through the night. A fire crackled in the brazier. He went to the cupboard to get some tea. On opening the door, his whole body began to shake with fright. He leaned against the wall, hugging his quivering limbs.</p>
<p>“Namu myōhō renge kyō! Namu myōhō renge kyō!” Even one character of that miraculous wondrous formula was enough to assure pardon and safe passage to that paradise of Amida, which Myōzen was in no great haste to visit. Shivering as if he had the chills, he watched the creature intently as it glided along the edge of the room and disappeared into the shadows. His shoulders shrugged up. A rat had nearly scared him out of his wits. His heart beat wildly and he had difficulty breathing through its stops and starts.</p>
<p>He had hardly sat down again and reached for the kettle when the sound of someone pounding loudly on the door startled him again. He stood up and stepped quietly over to the rain shutters to check the bolts. “Everything’s secure.” He jammed the door with a wooden stake and leaned against the panel to listen.</p>
<p>“Myōzen, open up and let me in! I can barely stand up in this storm. I have news for you—and a favor to ask.”Myōzen resisted the temptation.</p>
<p>“Who are you? What are you doing out at this hour and in such weather? My door stays closed tonight. Go away and come back in the daytime.”</p>
<p>“With all due respect, your presence is required. Please open and at least hear what I have to say. I beg you, as a priest who helps those in need.” </p>
<p>Despite the terrified tone, there was something familiar about the voice. It did not give in but continued to plead: priests are supposed to console those who have suffered misfortune. Iwa had been, and still was, one of those. Myōzen listened through the door but could not bring himself to open it.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Identify yourself or this conversation is over. I am not well this evening; actually, I’m sick. Return at dawn and I will receive you.”</p>
<p>“Who am I? Don’t you recognize my voice? This is Tomobei, from the house of Kondō Rokurobei. Please open up. My master is in need of your help.</p>
<p>The tone of urgency and the important role Kondō had played in Myōzen’s life relieved his hesitancy. Slowly he unbolted the door and let Tomobei in, dripping wet as he was. The visitor dropped his straw raincoat at the entrance. His eyes and behavior were frantic and he kept looking back towards the storm raging furiously outside. When Myōzen turned around to go back into the room, Tomobei grabbed him by the skirts.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Myōzen demanded curtly.</p>
<p>“Something awful has happened,” Tomobei replied. “It’s terrible. Today the master was making ready to attend the funeral of the old-timer Kaiho. His wife was putting a house dress in the closet. Tama, who is only seven years old, was playing in the upper hallway. She leaned over to watch her father leave and lost her balance. She fell over the edge and landed on the bamboo spikes mounted to keep out intruders, robbing the master of his most precious treasure. The knife-like spikes drove through her throat and chest and out the back. It was terrifying to watch. All he could do was call out, ‘Tomobei, Tomobei!’ Nothing we could do to saw off the points and free the child helped; it only made matters worse. We fetched a ladder, but by the time we had taken her down, alas, she was dead. The master raged around the house distraught and inconsolable—nearly deranged. His wife cried out, ‘Myōzen, he loved the child. Call him here to say a prayer and direct her spirit while it still hovers around us.’ That is why I have come. I would rather be scourged in the courtyard of white sand where prisoners await their punishment than face the darkness where Iwa wanders about.”</p>
<p>The two of them were weeping: Tomobei in fear and confusion over the distress of the household, Myōzen at the sudden and dreadful fates of this child whom he, as a monk who had abandoned the world for a solitary life, had loved as if she were his own. So overtaken with the misfortune of his lifelong friend that he forgot his own problems, he bowed down in prayer.</p>
<p>“Namu myōhō renge kyō, Name myōhō renge kyō!”</p>
<p>He stood up. “I will go with you.”</p>
<p>As the two of them battled their way through the storm, Tomobei talked incessantly, venting a nonsensical string of superstitions that frighten the lower classes.</p>
<p>“There’s no way. The whole thing is horrible, but I can feel it. Something evil is in the air…. What’s that? Something passed by… up above. It’s Iwa!”</p>
<p>He grabbed the priest’s arm and clung to him in terror. Myōzen’s worst fears had returned. He would have run away, but Tomobei had too tight a grip on him.</p>
<p>“Where, where?”</p>
<p>Myōzen shrieked and spun around toward Samegebashi Bridge. Tomobei held on tenaciously. A figure was bearing down on them in the dark. It was almost upon them. They jumped to one side. A cold hand fell on the priest’s neck and he squawked in fear. A howling sound answered as the two men screamed and beat the air about them. Realizing it was futile, they fell flat on the ground to block the apparition from view. The beast sped off down the hill.</p>
<p>Confused, Myōzen disentangled himself from the broken water spout hanging down from the roof under which he had taken shelter and sending a cold stream of water down his neck. Tomobei drew himself up from the mud puddle where he had lain face downward. They gazed at each other.</p>
<p>“A dog. It was a wild stray!”</p>
<p>Myōzen looked with disgust at his once immaculate garments. How could he present himself in such a state? Tomobei read his thoughts but was not about to lose the companion he had gone to such lengths to secure.</p>
<p>“Only the master, his wife, the maid Kiku and I were there. There was no one else. Oh, yes, except for the child, that is.”</p>
<p>“A corpse does not need company,” replied Myōzen testily.</p>
<p>He was irritated at his disgraceful, unkempt appearance and at the loss of his little friend. Still, he had to see it through. They arrived at the western side of the cemetery of Sainen-ji temple.</p>
<p>“There is a break in the fence,” Tomobei pointed out. “We don’t need to go down the hill, and besides, no path is more appealing than any other at this time of night. Let’s just run through the cemetery. Before you can count to ten, we’ll be at the rear entrance. Make a dash for it, my good priest.”</p>
<p>By this time, Myōzen was up for anything. He tucked in his robes as if he were taking part in a race. They crawled through the bamboo fencing and entered the haunt of the dead, rushing madly ahead in the direction of Kondō’s house. Tomobei was the more agile. He turned to watch the priest tripping over humps in the grass and knocking into gravestones obscured by the darkness. They were near and that gave him courage. Tomobei burst into laughter at the sight of Myōzen hammering away at a battered old stone snow-viewing lantern. Its wide brim looked like a hat on some natural or supernatural being, and he pummelled away at it with language hardly befitting a holy monk. Tomobei ran back to the rescue. Myōzen was battered and bleeding as the two of them rushed into Kondō’s house.</p>
<p>The master was expecting them, but he threw up his hands in bewilderment as they appeared in the room.</p>
<p>“My good priest, and you, Tomobei! What has happened? Why do you run into the room with your clogs still on? Please step back. You’re soiling the tatami and leaving mud everywhere…. Bring some water for Myōzen’s feet! Tomobei, have you gone crazy? Out with you. Get a bucket and clean up this mess.”</p>
<p>The priest stepped back in confusion before apologizing profusely.</p>
<p>“I am heartbroken at your loss. What has happened here, it’s just unspeakable. If I could only take on part of the grief that you and your wife are feeling. What greater sorrow than such an end for one who was just beginning her life.”</p>
<p>Kondō’s wife burst into tears at the words of condolence. Then she turned furiously at her husband.</p>
<p>“It is all Rokurobei’s fault. He was the go-between for Iwa’s marriage to Iemon. Then he turned against her and brought Hana into the house. Did she not wile away the hours teaching our child the ways of her shady life, indeed, ‘how to please men’?… But our Tama had such a cute way about her. She was only seven but she could dance and sing and strike a pose of a girl twice her age. And now she’s gone, so cruelly.”</p>
<p>Her thoughts had strayed for a moment, but she soon regained her train of thought.</p>
<p>“The plot against Iwa cooked up by Kaiho, Iemon, and Chōzae­mon—that is the cause of this calamity. Iwa’s last words were a curse against them all. So now it’s Kondō and his unfortunate wife’s turn.”</p>
<p>With another outburst of tears, she rested her head on the tatami at the feet of the priest. Kondō paced up and down the room, gesticulating wildly and almost shouting.</p>
<p>“Yes! It’s her! The spiteful Iwa has used the child to strike at its father. What a cowardly act to bring someone in the first blush of life to such a monstrous end! Iwa is seeking revenge. I know she’s around here somewhere; I just can’t find her.”</p>
<p>His yelling and emotional fits were deafening. Myōzen knew that it would not be easy to restore peace to the household, given the rift between a husband and wife smitten with fear of the supernatural. He would have to rely on his priestly experience.</p>
<p>“I understand. But shouting will not help. We must implore the Buddha on behalf of the deceased.”</p>
<p>He apologized to the wife for his appearance. She rose at once and saw to it that his outer garments were removed so that he could change out of his muddy undergarments. Myōzen entered the room where the little jewel of a child, Tama, lay as if asleep. The wound in her chest and the tear in her throat were concealed by her clothing and a band of bandages arranged with the sad and tender care of her mother. Incense sticks lay in clay dishes near the couch.</p>
<p>“Praise to the wondrous Dharma! Praise to the Lotus Sutra! Namu myōhō renge kyō, Name myōhō renge kyō!”</p>
<p>Myōzen looked long upon the small, silent figure. His eyes were filled with tears as he turned and took the hands of the weeping mother who had followed him into the room. He spoke to her at length and she seemed somewhat calmer when they returned.</p>
<p>Kondō Rokurobei was still pacing restlessly about the house, now in the parlor with the corpse, now in the sitting room with the others, now in the kitchen. His wife remembered that she had to attend to their friend.</p>
<p>“Tomobei, go to the storeroom and bring some saké.”</p>
<p>Myōzen was a man of curious disposition and she had touched on his weak spot.</p>
<p>“Yes, the lady of the house has a splendid idea. We should respect the occasion, but more cheerfully. Uncontrolled grief only beings sorrow to the spirits of the dead by binding them to the living. Death does not mark the misfortune of being cut off from further existence in this world, but a passage to the paradise of Amida.”</p>
<p>He spoke smoothly with the voice of authority, as one prepared to experience his theory in person. His sermon had no effect on Tomobei, who flatly refused to do as told.</p>
<p>“The saké…,” Kondō reprimanded.</p>
<p>“The cellar at the end of the lot. It’s very late, and with the storm and those other things.… It’s a squall out there. I…”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” roared his master, whose anger was by then easily aroused. Kiku intervened timidly.</p>
<p>“We have a supply in the kitchen. I brought it there earlier thinking it might be needed. The storm is really bad. You’d get wet to the bone just crossing the yard.”</p>
<p>Lady Kondō picked up on the last words of the maid.</p>
<p>“Wet and chilled—that is how the spirit of our lost child wanders, ringing its bell in vain search of aid and shelter. The only one listening is the heartless hag who lurks around the shores of the Sanzu no Kawa River, hoping to waylay the dead on their way to the afterlife.”</p>
<p>She broke down again at the thought of poor little Tama out in the cold and rain. Dissolved in tears, she crawled along the tatami and out of the room to lay down beside the casket.</p>
<p>Saké was served. Myōzen drank his share and kept on drinking. The more he had to drink, the more confident he grew to perform the functions for which he had been summoned.</p>
<p>“Let us pray. Namu myōhō renge kyō, Name myōhō renge kyō! Wonderful is the sutra and the Dharma by which all beings are saved and given entry into the paradise of Amida. Rest assured, the wanderings of Tama will be short. The old hag Datsue-ba who waits for children at the edge of the river to the afterlife is too feeble to catch her. Soon the child shall sit upon a lotus blossom. Her entry into the bliss of nirvana is nigh. Namu myōhō renge kyō, Name myōhō renge kyō! Master Kondō, let us all pray together. Kindly have the servants join in the recital of the mantra.”</p>
<p>Kondō waved a hand at Tomobei and Kiku to comply with the priest’s wishes. One and all they intoned their responses vigorously. Myōzen had more to drink. He kept filling the cups of those around him that they might oblige him in return. The night was pressing on. It was already past one o’clock, but the priest was still going strong.</p>
<p>“We must remain vigilant. Don’t get drowsy on me. It’s time now for another prayer. Let us put our all into it.”</p>
<p>He raised his hand. “Namu myōhō renge kyō, Name myōhō renge kyō!” The responses were half-hearted.</p>
<p>“This won’t do,” said the priest. “Not at this hour of the night.”</p>
<p>He reached for more saké to find that the supply had run out. Kondō was nodding off. Tomobei, if he was still awake, was not paying attention. Myōzen got up to fetch more saké himself.</p>
<p>Kondō’s ears pricked up. The temple bells were clanging out the hour in solemn harmony. The rain splashed and pattered against the shutters. A sound was coming from the next room, a rustling, swishing noise. Then it seemed as if a hand were running along the sliding screens. He sprang up and drew his sword. His eyes were riveted on the papered lattice, waiting for some sign of movement. Then all at once, with a forceful motion, he drew back the screen. There before him stood a tall figure robed in black, with a broad flat face and bulging brow, with puffy eyelids hovering over sunken little dots in place of eyes, and wildly disheveled hair framing a pale and lifeless face. “Iwa!” He knocked over a lamp as he recoiled, but not before getting off a strong upward blow. He sprang back frantically at the apparition, slashing this way and that in the dark. “Take that… and that!” His cries rang loudly throughout the house. He dropped his sword to his side and began to dance with joy, all the while calling for light.</p>
<p>“Iwa, Iwa! I have slain the obake, the enemy of our child! This calls for a celebration. The vendetta is over!”</p>
<p>A low groaning sound could be heard in the darkness and confusion. It grew fainter and then there was silence. Tomobei entered with a lamp. He leaned over the long body robed in black and turned back at his jubilant master with a look of alarm on his face.</p>
<p>“Why are you celebrating? What have you gone and done? It is Myōzen, the holy priest, who has been cut down. The master has made a dreadful mistake. It will cost the house dearly.… Namu myōhō renge kyō, Name myōhō renge kyō!”</p>
<p>The sword fell from Kondō’s hand. Totally overcome with grief, he knelt beside the body of the unfortunate priest, hoping for some sign of life. But no, Myōzen had nearly been cut in two by the upward stroke of Kondō’s sword. From bottom to top his trunk was one gaping wound. He lay in a pool of what must have been nearly all the blood in his body. All four gathered around and eyed each other in panic.</p>
<p>Thump, thump. Thump, thump. They jumped up and huddled together. The sound seemed to strike on their very shoulders.</p>
<p>“Someone is knocking at the back door,” said Tomobei.</p>
<p>“Go and open it,” Kondō commanded.</p>
<p>Tomobei shook his head in brazen disrespect. Kondō picked up his bloody sword and deliberated. Why mingle vile blood with good, he thought to himself. Rather than smite the impudent servant, he went to see for himself. He unlatched and opened the top half of the door to see a woman standing out in the rain drenched, her hair all matted and her face as white as chalk. Kondō was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Why, it’s Kame, Yoemon’s wife. What brings you her? Word was that your husband had you confined like someone who had gone mad.” </p>
<p>The woman grinned broadly with a look of satisfaction.</p>
<p>“You, Kondō Rokurobei, are a seer as well as a murderer. I have been shut up and bound as a prisoner, and about to be divorced. Myōzen, who just now died at your hands, was to make the formal announcement. I suppose I should thank you for that. But your Tama has died and I have come to offer my condolences. Allow me to come in and light a stick of incense.”</p>
<p>“How do you know of Myōzen’s death,” Kondō snapped back. “And who told you what happened to Tama?”</p>
<p>Kame laughed barbarically.</p>
<p>‘‘Who? Iwa, my friend Iwa told me. It was she who freed me from my bonds so I could come here. ‘Tama of the Kondō household is dead,’ she said. ‘You should go and console her mother and my friend. We must hurry, for her husband Rokurobei has just murdered the priest.’ So here we are—Iwa and I. And here she is,” announced Kame with a wave of her hand into the stormy dark. “Kindly show us the way to the room where Tama lies. We would like to offer incense in memory of the dear little jewel.”</p>
<p>Kondō let out a yell and grabbed hold of the front of her robe.</p>
<p>“Vile old trot, off with you!”</p>
<p>He shoved her roughly, landing her on her backside. She just lay there, laughing at the top of her lungs. She held out two skinny arms in his direction, but he slammed the door shut and returned despondently to the side of the lifeless priest.</p>
<p>“Iwa is about. How could that lunatic of a woman know what happened here? What offence did Myōzen commit to deserve the hatred of Tamiya Iwa?”</p>
<p>As is turns out, Kame had seen the priest enter and stood outside in the rain listening to Kondō talk to himself. When she saw the bloody sword in his hand, she put two and two together. As for Tama, Kame had overheard people talk of her death from the room where she was being held captive. Neither of these scenarios occurred to Kondō. He was on out of sorts with Akiyima and had not informed him of anything. As the questions spun around in his head, he wondered, too, how he might smooth things over with the temple. It was cause for grief enough that a rash blow from his own sword had fallen on a friend, but now he had to think about the restitution the infuriated monks were sure to exact from him. A clamor arose outside. He heard wild cries and a scream of pain, followed by loud, triumphant shouting.</p>
<p>“Everyone, come look. Iwa is dead! I’ve struck down the obake. The shadow that haunts the ward has been lifted. Come help!”</p>
<p>Kondō sprang to his feet and out of the house. Was it true? Had someone else succeeded where he had failed? His lantern and those of several others threw cast their light on Akiyama Chōzaemon as he bravely stood watch over the prostrate body of the apparition. He had returned to the ward late from the Shita-machi district, fearing for his life. As he made his way furtively, watching every dark corner for a sign of danger, he noticed the figure of a woman standing beneath the eaves of Kondō’s house.</p>
<p>At his approached, she stepped out of the shadows laughing frenziedly. The light from his lantern fell on the ghastly white face and disheveled hair. Convulsed with fright, he dropped the lantern and drew his sword, delivering a blow in one swift motion. The long gash was almost identical to that inflicted on the priest Myōzen. The men who had gathered around looked into each other’s faces and then at the body of Kame lying on the ground before them. The crowd stepped aside as Tamiya Yoemon appeared. Kondō and Akiyama stood there alone, self-accused, with bloodied swords and not a scratch on either of them.</p>
<p>The outcome of the whole affair was disastrous for everyone involved. The goings on in Yotsuya had begun to reach the ears of the authorities. Yoemon was made to bring charges against Akiyama, which he did so willingly as it gave him an opportunity to escape the losses he would have suffered had his divorce gone ahead on the following day. Kondō had no trouble convincing the officials to clear him of his own offence, but he still had the irate temple monks to deal with. In addition, all three of them were caught up in the heavy legal fees of those days. There will be more to say of these men later.</p>
<p>20 Master Kihei</p>
<p>Kihei was in dire straits both financially and domestically. Kaiho’s demise had brought him anything but independence. Relieved of the restrictions imposed by his office, the old man’s hands were free to shower benefits on his friends and harass his adversaries. He issued endorsements for money and goods to Natsume, Imaizumi, and Kamimura. He offered donations to the temples of Tera-machi and the Yotsuyazaka. He dispersed favors in every direction except in that of Akiyama Chōzaemon, whom he took great amusement in hounding. All of this, plus the wasteful lifestyle of his household, placed heavy demands on his ample revenue of two hundred and thirty sacks of rice and might well have been no more than a typical example of a samurai not knowing the value of money. But such was not the case with Kaiho. Between him and his son, the wild debaucheries of the last year had brought the house to the brink of insolvency. </p>
<p>Kihei was at a loss at what to do. For some time now he had been deeply involved with the glamorous Tamagiku of the Yamadaya, located on the first block of Edo-machi in Yoshiwara. Ugly as he was, he had fallen madly in love with the renowned beauty. Beginning from half a year prior to Kaiho’s illness, he had lavished her with family treasures. During his subsequent absence, letters from her piled up on Kihei’s desk. Had he deserted her? Did he no longer have feelings for her? What had become of his promise to ransom her from service? Had he forgotten the vow they had sealed in blood to become husband and wife, and to remain together in this world and the next? Kihei felt depressed as he read through the letters, cursing his father and cursing himself. Ransom! If he skimped and saved for the next five years, he might be able to settle his accounts and liberate her from courtesanship. But any day she might be sold off to some rich country gentleman or carried away to decorate the villa of some shōgun’s vassal. Kihei wiped the bitter saliva from his lips.</p>
<p>Domestic problems only complicated these more pressing financial concerns. Kihei was all alone now in the large house. The tenth day after the funeral saw the last of the servants depart. The women had fled in fear, sacrificing their wages and leaving behind whatever clothing they could not sneak out. What woman, what man could stay around in a house where night after night such gruesome sounds echoed through the halls? Shrieking and wailing and groaning issued from the rooms once occupied by Kaiho. On this everyone was in agreement.</p>
<p>The more adventurous of the servants had actually witnessed the scenes enacted. They saw the corpse of the old man being pursued from room to room by two gaunt and gossamer old crones, as sightless as he himself. The screams of the dead man were chilling as the frightful harpies fell on him like bats swooping down from above. These events usually materialized around one o’clock in the morning and continued uninterrupted until dawn.</p>
<p>The menservants took their leave shortly after the women, one by one submitting a formal resignation with a request for recommendation to another household. They could sense the impending demise of their present employer.</p>
<p>Kakusuke walked in one day, and with one look Kihei understood that he, too, was about to leave. He alone had stayed behind. In addition to his responsibilities as attendant, he served as stable boy, cook, and housekeeper. He did the work of all four without complaint. But the change in his master was too marked. Kihei had grown irritable, timid as a young girl, and subject to outbreaks of anger bordering on insanity. To Kakusuke, his young master seemed to have lost all his nerve. It was not the kind of man he wanted to serve. As long as there was some hope of redemption, some indication that he would rise above his difficulties and reemerge to make a noble career that would do Kakusuke proud, he was prepared to take the bitter with the sweet. But to become a maid and warden of someone gone half mad held no attraction for one as unfeeling as he.</p>
<p>“You should cut all ties with this house. Given the way things are, there is no way to avoid forfeiture. Your best course of action is to return to the original family house in Honjo Yokokawa. At least that way you will save yourself. This is my advice as an old hand when it comes to serving in a samurai household. Anything else is hopeless. As for me, I would ask that you relieve me of my service.”</p>
<p>Itō Kaiho and Inagaki Shōgen had a long and close relationship. Kakusuke had played the role of messenger between the two houses. He had watched young Fukutarō, as Kihei was then known, grow into manhood and develop his talents. He was overjoyed at being able to transmit the adoption papers that brought such new and vigorous blood into the home of his decadent master. And this was the result.</p>
<p>“A pest on these witches and their craft!”</p>
<p>Kihei was fuming but heard him out. As his attendant’s words became clearer and more firm, his hand wandered over to his sword. He had a mind to cut him down there and then for such impudent talk. Still, he had enough good sense to recognize the truth of the indictment and his better judgment stopped him from going any further. His tone was harsh and sardonic as he feigned gratitude for the guarded rebuke. Kakusuke’s service had been faithful beyond measure. It should have its proper reward. The others who had chosen to depart were simply running away from what they did not understand. He pulled open a desk drawer and he took out a letter he had already prepared together with the attendant’s wages. He set them on a tray and pushed it toward Kakusuke. Even though he had prepared himself for this moment, it hit him hard. Respectfully he pressed the letter to his forehead and bowed on the tatami with his hands extended. He did not touch the money. At last he gave a nervous and inquisitive glance towards his onetime master. Kihei jeered back at him.</p>
<p>“You have given your advice. Is it part of your long experience that a servant should question the wages placed under his nose? Off with you! I want to be alone. I prefer it that way.”</p>
<p>Perceiving the threat, Kakusuke no longer hesitated. He had no wish to fall victim to another of the young man’s crazed outbursts. He picked up the roll of money nervously and backed out of the room. A few moments later, steps could be heard near the entrance. The outer gate shut closed with a clang.</p>
<p>Kihei sat for some time in meditation, looking as if he had dozed off. Then he rose abruptly with determination.</p>
<p>“’This is my last chance. Kakusuke is right. I must bring this matter to an end.”</p>
<p>Kihei donned his street clothes and walked out of the house. He opened the large gate and went to the stable to saddle and bridle his horse. He led it outside, closed the gate behind him, and mounted. From there he rode to Honjo Yokokawa and the residence of Inagaki Shōgen. Arriving alone and unaccompanied, he was received with surprise and not a little annoyance. He was very quick to notice such things these days.</p>
<p>Kihei prostrated himself before his mother.</p>
<p>“It is I, Fukutarō. Pardon the intrusion, mother, but I have come to implore your understanding and influence.”</p>
<p>The lady looked at him with amazement.</p>
<p>“Fukutarō! What happened to Kihei? Is this some kind of joke at my expense? If so, it is in very bad taste…. But I see from you face that you are not jesting. Please, state you purpose plainly. Why does my son come begging to me?”</p>
<p>“It is a very serious matter,” Kihei began. He proceeded to explain in detail, from the time of his adoption into the Itō family, through the time of debauchery and Kaiho’s illness, down to the ruination he was now facing.</p>
<p>“All this is due to the curse Iwa pronounced on those involved in the plot, in which I foolishly played a part.”</p>
<p>Kihei was feeling the full force of what had happened. The events of the past weeks had left him a wreck in mind and body. He had suffered one disaster after another, both at home and in the ward. As Kaiho’s representative, he was feeling the bitterness and dislike of the people of the ward against the old-timer. He was forced to live alone in his father’s sprawling residence. No servant would enter to attend to his needs. Was he to be his own cook and valet, and, at the same time, pose as chief of the ward? He was in an impossible position. He begged his mother to exercise her influence with his father.</p>
<p>“Can you help me get my father’s permission to return to the family I was born into and cancel the adoption?”</p>
<p>She sat there bewildered by the tale and at the radical step he was proposing to extricate himself from his predicament. His haggard appearance betrayed the strain of the past weeks and her mother’s heart was filled with pity for the muddle in which her son had landed. As a woman, she believed in the power of a curse issued by one who had died without proper funeral rites or prayers.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, your father is on night watch at the castle these days, so he should be at home now drinking saké. He is in a good mood. Wait here a moment.”</p>
<p>She left Kihei and went to the room where Shōgen was taking light refreshment. Under the kindly influence of the saké, the usually severe and conscientious nobleman was rather accommodating.</p>
<p>“Kihei? He is most welcome. The heir of old man Kaiho has not paid much attention to his real father of late. To be sure, the boy was well placed. Kaiho was quick to take him in, but none too willingly, I can assure you.”</p>
<p>He snickered, but noting the troubled look on his wife’s face, inquired further.</p>
<p>“Is there something more you want to tell me””</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact, there is, and it is not very pleasant.”</p>
<p>She repeated to him the story she had just heard from Kihei.</p>
<p>“He’s in deathly fear of Iwa. The house of Kondō is in tatters and there is no longer any benefit for us in maintaining the connection. I think you should proceed to cancel the adoption and return our son to the home of his true parents.”</p>
<p>Her husband’s stern glare of disbelief stopped her short.</p>
<p>“Let him in. I will answer him in person…. Hey, up you come! Saké awaits Master Itō Kihei….”</p>
<p>Kihei was overjoyed to heed his father’s call. His way out was at hand. Once again he would marshal his father’s retainers and accompany him to the castle; once again, he would frequent the fencing halls.</p>
<p>“Dearest father, I am afraid it has been too long since I have ventured into your presence.”</p>
<p>And you don’t need to do so for a long time again,” thundered the old man.</p>
<p>“What is all this stuff I am hearing? You wish to annul your connections with the house of Itō? You’re terrified of a ghost, and a female ghost at that? Who ever heard of a samurai who wears two swords being afraid to confront a woman! Do you think I have no obligations towards my old friend Kaiho? I would give my life and throw my lot in with him in matters more serious than yours. Back with you to your house in Yotsuya! If this discussion were to become known, you and I would both be the laughing stock of Edo. At least keep your fears to yourself. Off with you, then! My saké was waiting for Master Itō. That fellow who tries to go by the name of Fukutarō will have none of it.”</p>
<p>He kicked at the table and sent it tumbling along with the carafes of saké and the heating pans. He stormed out of the room.</p>
<p>Kihei’s face was white as he picked himself up from the tatami.</p>
<p>“Father has no experience of ghosts. He is rambling and speaks in anger. The truth is more terrible than he knows.”</p>
<p>Kihei’s mother spoke slowly, struggling to find the words.</p>
<p>“He is your father and is to be obeyed.”</p>
<p>Kihei sat upright and nodded solemnly in assent. He immediately fell to his knees and bowed ceremoniously before the papered screens behind which Shōgen had disappeared. He repeated the gesture to his mother and rose to leave.</p>
<p>“I will go now. May good health and fortune be visited upon this house.”</p>
<p>His mother was glad to see him go. Shōgen’s words were harsh, but they had brought their son to his senses. She was still shaking from the reproof with tears in her eyes. Men know best when it comes to such things. She would say a prayer at Reigan-ji and request a memorial service for Iwa that she might rest in peace in the next world. That would lift the curse from her son.</p>
<p>On his return, he found a foot solider waiting at the entrance to lead out his horse. Kihei waved him away.</p>
<p>“Hold it in the stable for now. The matters I have to attend to are close enough to allow other means of transport.”</p>
<p>As the man walked the animal away, Kihei closed the front gate of the residence behind him and walked the short distance to a rickshaw stand at the Hōon-ji Bridge.</p>
<p>“To the Yamadaya in Yoshiwara.”</p>
<p>The driver trotted off and Kihei fell pensive.</p>
<p>“I played and lost. Let’s see, how do things stand with my accounts? I owe seventy ryō to the Matsuminatoya. With what’s left over, I can afford a night with the beauty Tamagiku. Even if her affections have cooled, the huge sums I have paid out in the past should give me a claim on her. Then all that remains is to put an end to it all and die like a samurai. Tomorrow I shall commit seppuku.”</p>
<p>These thoughts led him directly to the Yamadaya and not to the tea house where he planned to square his debts. He sat brooding over his saké and nothing his beloved courtesan did seemed to cheer him up. He smiled dejectedly at her frustration and tried to apologize.</p>
<p>“My mind is elsewhere. The household is in ruins and beyond salvation. This is our last meeting. Tomorrow I will cut open my bowels and die like a samurai.”</p>
<p>At first the girl thought he was joking, but then she caught sight of the fierce look of despair in his eyes. She became frightened, partly in disbelief, partly in the hope of postponing his resolve and giving him time to think things over, and partly out of a sentimentality occasionally found in women of her class.</p>
<p>“Are you really ruined, Kihei? And what of my sad fate? Shall I join you in death? Everything is moving too fast. Why not put it off for a time? Tonight you shall take your pleasures with me, and when the darkness returns tomorrow, I will depart with you, hand in hand, to wander the paths of Amida’s paradise.”</p>
<p>She moved in closer to pour more saké. Throwing her arms about him, she drew him to her bosom and did everything in her power to comfort and beguile him into seeing things her way. Consent came easy and the night passed in love and saké. He left in the morning.</p>
<p>Kihei was making his final preparations, setting out instructions to benefit the household in Honjo, as far as possible at the expense of that in Yotsuya. Meanwhile, a very different scene was taking shape in Yoshiwara. No sooner had Kihei left than Tamagiku sprang up. She hastily threw on a robe and ran to the room of Kayo, the madam of the house.</p>
<p>“A courtesan coming to me at this hour! What’s happened?”</p>
<p>“Something important. This very night I will die with Master Kihei. The pact is sealed tight.”</p>
<p>The astonished brothel keeper had been rubbing the sleep out of her eyes when those last words brought her full to her senses.</p>
<p>“Are you hung over or just plain crazy? It must be one or the other. And what about the poor fellow who’s to pay the indemnity for your loss? All right, so it’s Tōemon of Honjo. But he already has trouble enough. He’ll never be able to recover.” </p>
<p>Tamagiku gestured impatiently.</p>
<p>“I am only trying to gain time. Do you really think I could have feelings for someone as ugly as he? That I would get caught up in such reckless stupidity? Perhaps the light of day will bring him around, but the conversation we had last night does not augur well. His plans are nearly complete. You must go and see the master, and please intervene to keep Kihei from being let back in as a guest.”</p>
<p>Kayo nodded her understanding and assent. She sought out the master of the house at once.</p>
<p>“A dangerous guest indeed,” he agreed.</p>
<p>“Send word to the Matsuminatoya. They must be warned. We can look after ourselves.”</p>
<p>An attendant of the tea house presented himself to receive the master of the Yamadaya.</p>
<p>“And where is the master Heisuke?”</p>
<p>“He is away. Tōsuke, at your service, is here in his stead. He has gone to Edo, I suppose to inquire after a new recruit—and a genuine beauty at that. The daughter of Akiyama Yotsuya is to sacrifice her social standing to get her father out of great difficulties. A mere sixteen she is, but a real jewel. She’s available for under a hundred ryō.”</p>
<p>Tōsuke was bubbling with enthusiasm. The answer was prompt and emphatic.</p>
<p>“Agreed. Keep her around for later in the day. But Tōsuke, I am here on another matter. Kihei is no longer to be admitted as a guest.”</p>
<p>He explained in details. Tōsuke took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“He’s a dangerous sort! The master never liked having him around anyway. But he owes the Matsuminatoya a handsome sum, seventy ryō.”</p>
<p>“That is your affair,” replied the master of the Yamadaya stiffly. “We are not responsible for the accounts of this tea house. You’ve been given notice. Kihei is not to be received as guest.”</p>
<p>“I don’t doubt it. He is an undesirable sort. But what of the seventy ryō and the week’s settlement he has yet to make with our house?”</p>
<p>The master of Yamadaya had an idea.</p>
<p>“It won’t come to more than a hundred ryō all together…. Is five years acceptable? You can have thirty ryō now and see that the girl is delivered to the Yamadaya…. If she’s the real beauty you say she is, we’ll have no trouble covering what Kihei owes you.”</p>
<p>Tōsuke gleefully accepted the offer.</p>
<p>At night the rickshaw driver set Kihei down in front of the Matsuminatoya. Heisuke, the master of the tea house, regarded his arrival with mixed feelings. His arrival was of some moment. After checking his swords, Kihei took a seat and at once expressed his thanks for services rendered. He asked for his accounts and produced the seventy ryō he owed to settle the books. On behalf of the house, Heisuke demurely expressed his gratitude for the unexpected payment of the balance due. Kihei had secured the money by selling the debt that Akiyama Chōzaemon owed him to Suzuki Sanjūrō the moneylender. Even that old shark was only too happy to shell out seventy ryō in exchange for a promissory note of three hundred and fifty ryō.</p>
<p>Heisuke was impressed. How could he deny service to such a guest? He hit upon a way to get rid of him and at the same time turn a profit with both hands. He would get the Yamadaya immediately to pay up the additional seventy ryō due on the girl whom they were only too delighted to recruit into their house. He had only paid fifty ryō for her.</p>
<p>At Kihei’s beckoning, Heisuke gave the order.</p>
<p>“Tōsuke, accompany Kihei to the Yamadaya.”</p>
<p>Kihei’s calm and collected manner reassured Heisuke that he did not have suicide on his mind.</p>
<p>There was great commotion at the Yamadaya when Tōsuke and Kihei showed up. One of the managers, a certain Matsuzō, stepped forward respectfully. As Kihei walked up to the front hallway and shook off his clogs, he stopped him from going further.</p>
<p>“Master Kihei, please wait a moment. Things have changed since this morning. Your lady friend Tamagiku has taken seriously ill and cannot receive visitors. We would ask you kindly to come another time. The pleasures of our house are not the right pastime for an ailing body. We ask your consideration and beg you to excuse us this once.”</p>
<p>Kihei was surprised. She was perfectly well when he left her that morning. Something in Matsuzō’s face and the resolute posture of the men standing alongside alerted him to what was really going on. He was infuriated at the insult and boldfaced lie.</p>
<p>“Ill? That’s odd. She was just fine this morning. But it doesn’t matter. I’ll go to her room all the same.”</p>
<p>“Not possible,” the manager replied firmly. “She is laid up in isolation from the others in the house, by order of the physician. Even those in the nearby rooms have been evacuated. We ask for your patience.”</p>
<p>Kihei was obstinate.</p>
<p>“Then allow me to place a glass of saké at her bedside. I have something I need to tell her.”</p>
<p>The manager refused to budge.</p>
<p>“Saké! Around the smell of medicine and the unsightly vessels of a sick room? There’s no way that would be allowed.”</p>
<p>Kihei thrust out an arm and sent the manager flying a dozen feet or more. He made a rush for the stairway, but the sour countenance of the brothel keeper Kayo stood in his path. She was intrepid and had the support of whole household behind her.</p>
<p>“How rude of you! Such inconsiderate behavior, and in such bad taste. Why, you’re no better than a roughneck foot soldier. The Yamadaya has no place for the miserable likes of you. The lady is ill, I tell you. Get out of here. Off to a coolie house with you. As we tell an insect when we toss it out the door, ‘Come back the day before yesterday!’”</p>
<p>Kihei let out a yell.</p>
<p>“You old bitch! It’s all clear to me. I am out of money and that is why I am no longer welcome. I will have my revenge.”</p>
<p>Unarmed and faced with the somber determination of these commoners, he felt helpless. There was no point in starting a brawl he could not win. He had no choice but to leave. He strode off to the tea house irate and steaming. Tōsuke did his best to keep up.</p>
<p>On their arrival, Heisuke pretended to be surprised. “Master Kihei! What just happened?”</p>
<p>Kihei stuttered and fumed but did not say a word. Heisuke turned to Tōsuke, who answered for him.</p>
<p>“They were positively disgraceful at the Yamadaya and wouldn’t let him in. The madam tossed him out onto the street like an insect!”</p>
<p>“Did she really? How rude of her!” Heisuke replied. “There’s no excuse for such behavior. We’ll have to look into this. For tonight, please leave it to me. Restitution will be made for the outrage.”</p>
<p>Heisuke waved his arms about in a defiant display of anger. Kihei ignored him and asked for his swords back. On the surface he had regained his composure. The maid Moto looked uncomfortably at her mistress, who was used to such scenes. At Kayo’s signal, the girl fetched the blades, carefully wrapped up, and placed them before Kihei. He rolled back the cloth and donned his swords. Then, with a perfunctory farewell, he marched off. Heisuke watched him disappear into the night.</p>
<p>“The Yamadaya would be wise to close early tonight, to take in their lanterns, board up the front, and take refuge in the storehouse.”</p>
<p>Tōsuke was in no hurry to face Matsuzō the manager again and looked at Heisuke quizzically. The easygoing old flesh-peddler spoke up decisively.</p>
<p>“Well, now it’s their affair. Their judgment is as good as mine, though they could have been more civil in refusing to entertain him. In any event, we have our seventy ryō and Kihei is in his right mind. He will put sword to bowels before dawn and it may not come back on us at all.”</p>
<p>He sauntered off to his inner room and sat down before a cup of saké at the very time Kihei was doing the same in an eatery opposite the great gates of Yoshiwara. There he bided his time, barely touching his drink as he chattered away with a maid named Kiyo. He was in a comical mood, joking that he would marry her and sell her the next morning, “just like over there.”</p>
<p>Kiyo was not amused.</p>
<p>“You have a lover, then?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” she blushed, slightly offended at the intimation that she might not.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll marry my own lover. Better to be the wife of a samurai, even for an hour.”</p>
<p>His boisterous manner frightened the girl. Earlier she had gone out to buy a hooded cap for him. She was relieved when he finally put it on and set out into the darkness and rain.</p>
<p>The hour was about to strike one o’clock. The licensed quarters were silent and the streets almost empty. An occasional shuffle of straw sandals behind the closed shutters could be heard. Kihei smiled cynically at the familiar, revolting sound of people moving from one room to another. He hesitated at the front of the Yamadaya. How to break in and kill them all? If he had his way, Tamagiku would be made to keep her word. Just then he detected voices from within and the sound of a crossbar falling. A number of late guests emerged, in the charge of Moto, the maid of the Matsuminatoya. Affectionate words of farewell were being addressed to the short-time wives.</p>
<p>“Please come again soon. Your Haya has thoughts for nothing but Mosuke.”</p>
<p>“Bunzaemon, be faithful to your Hana. I am sick when you are not with me and will see no one else.”</p>
<p>Peals of laughter broke out among the others. Bunzaemon scolded her for teasing him. Kihei stepped behind him. He walked with a limp and had lagged behind. Kihei pulled at his sleeve. The townsman, was startled at the sight of the hooded samurai.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid,” Kihei reassured him. You must have forgotten your pipe or purse or something else. You have to go back and get it.”</p>
<p>The man fumbled through his garments and became agitated at his failure to understand.</p>
<p>“A friend of mine is in the Yamadaya. It is late and they will not open for an unfamiliar voice. I must get in. Please help me.”</p>
<p>The townsman finally caught on.</p>
<p>“Moto, wait a moment. My pipe….”</p>
<p>“What’s that? Forgotten your pipe?”</p>
<p>The girl walked the short distance back to the gate. She knocked and called out. The sleepy voice of Matsuzō answered and down came the crossbar. The girl turned around at her guests waiting down the street. She looked straight into the face of Kihei, dropped her lantern and scampered off with a muffled scream.</p>
<p>Matsuzō was frightened at the sight of the man standing before him. As Kihei threw back his hood off his hat, he turned to run but tripped and fell. Kihei grabbed him by the leg and pulled. A swift blow cut him through the shoulder. As he staggered to his feet, a second vicious flash of the sword sent his severed head to the ground. The watchman saw his chance to run and fled to the back of the kitchen. He scampered up a pillar and hid himself in a dark corner among the rafters. Kihei turned and carefully barred the gate from the inside. Taking the key from Matsuzō’s waistband, he locked the chain to the crossbar. Everything was ready now for him to make his rounds.</p>
<p>On the floor above, one of the managers and several of the women were tangling with Jūsuke, a drunken guest who was refusing to leave.</p>
<p>“So, as soon as your money runs out, so does your welcome in this hellhole. I won’t budge. I’m not afraid of this pack of foxes…. Thank you. I am indebted to you through this life and the next.”</p>
<p>A woman picked up his purse and returned it to him.</p>
<p>“So I’ve paid my bill? Shall I get an early start on the Tōkaidō road? Yes, I had quite forgotten.”</p>
<p>His mood had become all compliments and grace. And then he was back in a rage again.</p>
<p>“Aha, you hussy! What good is my purse if there’s nothing in it? Which of you has stolen from me?”</p>
<p>He was all in a bluster as he fumbled with his tobacco pouch. One of the women took his hand and placed it on the coin purse still in the folds of his waistband. He calmed down. They guided him to the head of the staircase.</p>
<p>“Be careful, Jūsuke. Don’t fall! You, manager, lend a hand here.”</p>
<p>The man brushed off the help and lurched half way down the flight of stairs. Suddenly he stopped and stared ahead. At the foot of the staircase stood Kihei, bloody sword in hand.</p>
<p>“You tell me to go down, but I cannot. Some fool is blocking the stairs…. Hey you, jackass, you’re in my way..”</p>
<p>“You get out of my way, you lush!”</p>
<p>Half growling, half snarling, Kihei squeezed his words through his teeth. The man held his ground stubbornly and Kihei made to push past him.</p>
<p>“Vermin!” he shouted, striking the samurai.</p>
<p>Kihei whirled with his sword and Jūsuke’s head rolled to the bottom of the steps. The blood splattered on Kihei from head to foot. It was hideous to behold.</p>
<p>The women tore off in all directions, while the manager covered their retreat.</p>
<p>“Master Kihei! Be reasonable. Get a hold of yourself!”</p>
<p>Kihei took a step toward the women’s rooms. The manager was scared out of his wits but bravely stepped in to protect them. He cried out for help, to anyone below or in the neighborhood who could hear him. Kihei caught up with him and cut him across neck. His severed body collapsed to the ground. Kihei let out a howl of joy.</p>
<p>Kayo the brothel keeper emerged to see what all the commotion was about. On recognizing Kihei she stopped in her tracks, frozen with fright. They faced each other on a balcony near the head of the stairway. Only a large brazier stood between Kihei and his revenge. He was surprised by its size, a good meter or meter and a half wide. The woman was running for her life. As he struggled to get within striking distance, fear seemed to give her wings. She leaped and darted this way and that. Kihei was stymied. He had to cut her off before she reached the staircase and the hallway. He hesitated just long enough for her to get her hands on an iron kettle and send it crashing down on his head. She started hurling pots and pans at him in quick succession. When she picked up the iron tripod to heave it at him, ashes got in her eyes. Kihei saw his chance and jumped in close to her. She managed to dodge the first swing of his sword. As Kihei recovered his balance, she bolted past him and jumped over the brazier, rushing to escape down the stairs just ahead. Her night-dress caught on the handle of the brazier and jerked her to the ground. In the flash of a sword, she was slashed from shoulder to midriff.</p>
<p>Kihei began his methodical check of the rooms. Most of the women thought the hubbub just another in-house quarrel that had nothing to do with them. He began with the beauty Tamagiku’s room, which was next to Kayo’s quarters. The reception room where her bedding was usually laid out was dark. The dim glow of a night lamp shone from her dressing room further inside. She was nowhere to be seen. He walked over to the papered sliding doors. As he threw them apart, he awakened a man lying asleep in the room. It was immediately obvious that he was not the beauty’s lover. Seeing Kihei towering over him with his sword drawn, the man stooped into a squat and pleaded for his life. To Kihei’s astonishment, he addressed him by name.</p>
<p>“Noble sir, I beg you, spare my life. I swear, your beauty Tamagiku is not here. She is spending the night with the master of the house. You will find her in his company.”</p>
<p>He pointed a finger in a general direction as he spoke. Kihei laughed uproariously. Given where they were, his directions were completely useless. He lowered his weapon.</p>
<p>“Chōbei, what a place and time to meet! What a coincidence. I am doubly grateful for what I have come to learn. You and I, we’re caught up in the same fate. I gladly leave you to the mercy of Iwa.”</p>
<p>His gaze was fixed on the face of the former flesh-peddler and never wandered for a moment. With a chilling twist of his hand, Kihei rushed from the room. Chōbei jumped under the covers and tucked in his head to shut out the image just then conjured up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kihei continued his search. One woman whom he woke from sleep called out to him, “Is that you, my little dark friend?” She trembled when she saw who it was. He ordered her sternly to lie down again and she readily obeyed. Her body was shaking so badly she could hardly move. In only one place did he encounter opposition. Parting the sliding doors on a small closet of a room, he came upon a young girl—a mere slip of a creature, hardly a woman—whose face was somehow familiar. Her narrow hips and undeveloped bosom made him wonder what she was doing in such a place. That is, until he caught a glimpse of the pure, oval beauty of her face. At seeing him, she sprang up in alarm. Still half-asleep, she hardly knew where she was.</p>
<p>“Father, father! There’s a man in my room. Help!”</p>
<p>Kihei shoved her back down on the mattress and rolled back her night-clothes with his bloody sword. Mistaking his intentions, as he moved to get at the closet in the back, the girl lunged at him. The sheer energy of her frenzy surprised him. As he threw her aside, she sunk her teeth deep into his hand. A combination of the stabbing pain and his impatience at being distracted from the pressing matter at hand was more than he could stand. Unable to shake her off, he thrust the point of the sword firmly into her throat. She spouted mouthfuls of blood and sank back onto the bedding, dying. A memory flashed across his mind’s eye on the way out of the room. Kihei had seen her in Yotsuya. It was none other than Tsuru, who had served him tea in the house of her father, Chōzaemon. How did she end up this vile den? He took a step back to see if he could help her, but she was already dead as a stone.</p>
<p>One of the courtesans, Nishikiyama, realized what was happening. She tried to clam the frightened servant girl who had come running.</p>
<p>“Be quiet child. This is no time to lose control of yourself. Help me get ready.”</p>
<p>She attired herself with the greatest of care, all in white, as befits a lady attending to a nobleman. She reached on the shelf for her koto harp and plucked the opening bars of a famous old song Jinmujō—”This Forever Fleeting Life”—said to have been sung by the famous Shizuka Gōzen when she performed a religious dance for the Shōgun Yoritomo at the Hachimangū shrine in Kamakura. As Kihei turned into the hallway, the voice of a courtesan singing to the accompaniment of the koto caught his ear. She sat bent over her stringed instrument as the papered screens were flung open. Kihei’s hair hung in disarray, outlining the ghastly white of his face splashed with the same streaks of red that covered his garments. As he stood transfixed at the entrance, the grand courtesan looked up, composed and courteous, to greet him.</p>
<p>“Master Kihei, what are you up to? Are you not a man of chivalry? Surely madness has taken hold of you, my good sir. My name is Nishikiyama. Please have a seat. I will take care of you. What has been done cannot be undone. Let your final cup of saké in life be drained to the last drop. I offer it to you humbly.”</p>
<p>Kihei could not take his eyes from her. The mind of this most unhappy man was flooded with light. The tempest of his passion was lifting. He advanced slowly into the room.</p>
<p>“No doubt you are right, noble lady. I have gone mad, quite mad.” He sank down before her on a cushion. At her signal, the servant girl placed a tray with a bottle of cold saké before her. Her slender, skilled hands raised it gracefully and poured it into the final cup this man doomed to die would drink. Kihei raised his cup to her and drained it to the last drop.</p>
<p>“Tamagiku is here on the lower floor. Tell me where she lies.”</p>
<p>Nishikiyama could see a wild fire returning to his eyes. She bowed her head toward him.</p>
<p>“My life is at your command, but my lips are sealed. How am I to answer?”</p>
<p>He looked down for a moment and then got up.</p>
<p>“Whose daughter might you be! Truly, no other lady in the land could display greater courage or more refined manners. My final farewell to life will be made to you.”</p>
<p>He performed the grave and ceremonious ritual of departure. As he walked out of the room, the woman buried her face in her hands, weeping bitterly. In a mixture of awe and gratitude, the frightened servant girl held out her hand and buried her face in the white robes of her lady courtesan.</p>
<p>Kihei trod the lower hallway somberly. He would disembowel himself at the pond in the garden. He was surprised to see a rain shutter open at the end of the walkway. He heard voices and noticed lanterns near the opening. A group of frantic-looking women had raised a ladder to the garden wall, but the bamboo spikes stood in the way.</p>
<p>A voice outside whispered, “The key to the gate. Here, take it.” She rushed past him and Kihei cried out. The frightened woman turned and recognized him as she hurried by. In a few steps he was on her. His raised sword fell upon her as she knelt down and tried to swerve out of its path. The sharp blade cut her from wrist and shoulder, and then from neck to loins. Kihei tossed his weapon aside. He leaned over her, dagger drawn. Grasping her severed head by the tresses, he gazed on it for a moment. Then slowly he walked over to the pond in the center of the garden. He washed his bloody trophy carefully and set it on a curbstone. Turning towards it, he bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>“I have kept my promise to you. Together you and I will cross the Shide no Yama road to the afterlife. In a moment, I shall follow.”</p>
<p>Seated before the head reposing on the curbstone, he opened his robes. Thrusting the already bloody dagger deep into his left side he slowly drew it across his midriff and made an upward cut. His body fell forward. Kihei had kept his word.</p>
<p>21 Temple Matters</p>
<p>Inagaki Shōgen received the news at dawn, just as he was leaving the castle at the end of his night watch. The old vassal smiled soberly, thanked the bearer of the message, and rewarded him generously. The litter bearers jogged on. The news had reached the whole retinue; the attendants and spearman whispered about it among themselves. On arriving at his residence, Inagaki made no motion to descend. The chamberlain lifted the curtain and cried out in alarm. The old man lay out stretched on the floor of the litter. A dagger and pool of blood told the rest of the tale. Shōgen had followed his son on the road over the Shide no Yama.</p>
<p>Akiyama Chōzaemon staggered into his house listlessly. Taking no notice of his wife and the cushion she had set down for him, or of the thinly disguised sob in her greeting, he stretched himself out on the tatami. He buried his face in his arms. His groaning frightened her.</p>
<p>“Welcome home, but don’t tell me further misfortune has befallen our house?”</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, shivered, sat up, and looked at her. His expression was bewildering. He and his family were staring ruin in the face, not just the thought of it, the actual fact.</p>
<p>“Suzuki is a liar and a thief. He promised to clear the books with fifty ryō and now he is demanding another twenty in interest.”</p>
<p>His voice rose to a high pitch as he laughed in despair.</p>
<p>“Seventy-five ryō interest, for a one-month loan, and a loan forced on me by Itō Kaiho. Kihei has squandered everything and now the debt reverts to me as guarantor. As long as Suzuki has been paid the interest, he can let the full principal, three hundred and fifty ryō, ride for the month. But if he doesn’t get the last twenty-five ryō by nine o’clock tomorrow morning, he will lodge a complaint with the authorities for immediate payment in full. As usual, the amount of the interest is inscribed on the face of the bond. The outcome is inevitable. I must commit seppuku or suffer dismissal from office.”</p>
<p>He looked his wife Tsuyu up and down and the last glimmer of hope faded from his eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, if only I could be sold off, we would have the money we need. Sadly, I am too old and ugly….”</p>
<p>How he hated her at this moment. She was half a dozen years older than he when the marriage had been arranged by their parents for purely financial reasons. Mizoguchi Hanpei was rich but reputed to be a skinflint. He had recently fallen into the Edo River as he was returning home late one night, inebriated. By the time they fished him out of the contaminated waters it was too late. After his death it was discovered that the old fellow of sixty some years had kept several concubines, which had eaten into the family fortune. His pension, of course, reverted to the household. But in all those years, Chōzaemon never received a dowry, nor did he dare press his wealthy father-in-law lest he endanger the generosity the old man had shown his daughter. Now that he was dead, the funds Chōzaemon so desperately needed were determined to be lacking. Had he been alive, Mizoguchi would probably have argued that the dowry had been paid in installments. Be that as it may, Akiyama’s wife would be no use in redeeming him from his situation, which was a cause of regret to her.</p>
<p>“For the sake of my house and husband, I would gladly join my daughter in that odious service. But once one is over forty…, well, it’s no use trying. Perhaps some other solution will present itself.”</p>
<p>She took out the armrest and placed it at his side. She watched him from a short distance away. From time to time the tapping of her pipe could be heard as she knocked out the ashes. Finally, no longer able to keep awake and with no sign of movement by her husband, she went off to bed, expecting him to follow shortly.</p>
<p>Tsuyu awoke with a start. “Father, father!” The voice of her daughter Tsuru rang out sharply. Tsuyu sat up in a daze and looked around. Sunlight was streaming through the cracks in the rain shutters. She had been dreaming. But where was her husband? Had he gone out? The cries of a passing peddler could be heard in the street.</p>
<p>“Tofu, tofu. Come get your best tofu!” Soybean curd was a tasty, inexpensive, and nutritious staple in their house, as it was in many others. Akiyama indulged his passion for gambling, saké, and the women of Shinjuku generously, but he was equally generous when it came to the daily regimen of tofu.</p>
<p>Tsuyu got up to answer the peddler’s call, but she began to grow increasingly uneasy. All the exits of the house were still barred and bolted from the night before. An open skylight window in the kitchen roof caught her eye. Surely he didn’t go out that way, she thought to herself. As she opened the back door, she could make out the murmur of voices in the road or nearby. The tofu peddler had turned his head away and was looking upward. He apologized for not answering her.</p>
<p>“Good day, my lady. Something strange has happened. Ah, I see your household is still asleep. Everything is silent. So strange…. A man hanged himself on the large oak tree in the temple grounds. You can see for yourself.”</p>
<p>He pointed to the giant oak of Myōgyō-ji. Sure enough, the body of a man was dangling forty feet from the ground. It swayed gently to and fro, in harmony with the rustling of the branches. Tsuyu felt something clasp at her heart. The enormous branches of the tree reached as far as their roof. The skylight window! Her voice was frail.</p>
<p>“My husband disappeared unexpectedly. Please, somebody, climb up and see if that man is… from the ward.”</p>
<p>Her words startled the peddler and he ran off to get help. Several men entered the garden and quickly climbed up on the roof where they were able to reach the tree. The first to arrive turned back to the others.</p>
<p>“Oh my, not a pretty sight at all. What a hideous spectacle! His face is black as a rice pot. It looks as if his eyes are about to pop out of his head and his tongue hangs off his face like a gourd. Oh, and that grin on his drooping lips—it’s not something you want to see. The poor rascal went and used the thinnest rope to cut through his neck. He almost succeeded. The head is nearly severed.”</p>
<p>Then the man hollered out, “Why, it’s…”</p>
<p>One of the others told him to keep his voice down. They looked down and signalled to those below. The women huddled around Tsuyu to guard her from the sight. She broke away as the body was gently lowered to the ground. Her shrieks filled the air. They tried to pull her away from body of her dead husband, Chōzaemon. The family was ruined, the lives of her daughter and husband taken on the same day. It was too much for a mind already long tormented by life with this worthless letch of a man.</p>
<p>Her guardians struggled to take care of her in her total break with sanity. Years after, those who had grown up in the ward as children still looked with pity on the ragged, feeble, mad old beggar crouching alongside the picturesque bronze dragon that adorned the water basin of the Ten’nō Shrine. They would drop a coin in her hand and drive away with a scolding any children who would tease and make fun of her the way they themselves had done when they were young.</p>
<p>And so it was that mother and daughter, both of them innocent of any wrongdoing, were caught up in Akiyama Chōzaemon’s crime against the dreaded Lady Tamiya.</p>
<p>The whole string of events caused a great stir in Yotsuya. The men dreaded going out at night. The women were frustrated at the inconvenience of being confined to the house. Two figures approaching each other in the darkness would stop and hesitate, each of them thinking to themselves, “What’s that slinking in the shadows over there by the wall? Why have I, Kinsaburō, why have I, Genzaemon, had the misfortune to be led into the clutches of the obake? Iwa, Iwa!” Then they would fall on each other in a frenzy, at times only letting up when one of them had been injured.</p>
<p>Quarrels and feuds broke out on all sides with no one to blame. Women were the chief suspects and suffered the most. The atmosphere in the area was overheated and nerve-racking. From Honjo to Naka-chō in Shinjuku, from Nakano-chō in Yoshiwara to Shinagawa, and even as far away as the post towns of Kawasaki, Tsurumi, and Kanagawa, talk spread of the strange goings-on in the Yotsuya district of Edo. Katada Tatewaki—a descendant of the notorious vassal of Ieyasu, Katada Samon, who once had held the Aoyama-Yotsuya district in fief—initiated an investigation into the matter.</p>
<p>The Katada family had considerable holdings elsewhere at the time he was granted control over the district. Samon designated a large tract of his new estate as temple land. On the old maps of the day, this part of Edo was marked off with splashes of blood-red ink to indicate the various establishments in the area. The influence of the Katada was still prevalent in the ward, thanks to an excess of good will on the part of those who had benefited from the family’s generosity.</p>
<p>Tatewaki’s residence was perched atop Ushigomezaka. His modest pension of a thousand bags of rice by no means represented the extent of his power. Iemon had grown fearful of the storm gathering about him. He was open to all suggestions for a remedy to Hana’s cataleptic state. The neighborhood gossips recommended calling in the Shinto priest from Shio-machi. Part of the Katada money was held in reserve in the ward and the Tamiya household had some share in it. But the fifty ryō needed for the services of the priest was a lot to the trustees, as indeed it was to Iemon in his present circumstances.</p>
<p>The neighbors assembled at the Tamiya house. Iemon went forth to greet the holy man with allegedly spiritual powers. He stood at the entrance with his assistant priest and retinue of attendants. Iemon knelt down to welcome the great man.</p>
<p>“Our deepest thanks for consenting to come. Please, enter our troubled home.”</p>
<p>Typical of his kind, the priest was brusque and officious in his response, like an overbearing samurai.</p>
<p>“Greetings one and all!”</p>
<p>His eyes swept across the assembly and missed nothing. He approached the couch where Hana was laid out with her eyes shut. He opened them and they stared, transfixed into space like the eyes of a corpse. He lifted one of her arms up from the body. Stepping to one side, he rested on his haunches. Some minutes passed. The arm remained rigid in its upright position.</p>
<p>When he had seen enough, the priest motioned to his attendants. Together they lifted Hana up and placed her in a seated position on the tatami. Her hair was arranged in a fan like the leaf of a ginkgo tree. A ritual Shinto staff with two decorative paper streamers was placed between her hands. The priest began to recite a series of prayers and incantations, his assistants chanting a response from time to time. Everyone present was awestruck. The women could hardly breathe. They leaned forward intently and their eyes were glazed over, almost as if they had been hypnotized. The staff began to shudder and then to shake violently. The woman’s hair fell down in disarray around her face. The onlookers turned away. Some of the women choked back their cries. It was none other than Iwa glaring at them through those eyes. Resolutely, the holy priest leaned in close to Hana.</p>
<p>“Iwa, where are you? What has become of your body? You must speak the truth. Don’t try to lie to this priest…. You don’t know? So, you remain obstinate about exacting vengeance. The enchanted staff trembles and quivers. It has taken hold of you…. What’s that? You wish to be laid to rest in the earth at Samon-chō? That is a lot to ask, particularly when there is no body to bury…. Will a substitute do? And prayers?… You want prayers to be said in the morning and every night for a year? That’s a tall order. Consider the cost…. You don’t care what it costs! Only if your demands are met will you cease afflicting the ward?… Very well, then. I will convey to the living the wishes of the dead.”</p>
<p>That was how the priestly medium interpreted Hana’s stuttering and mumbling to his dumbstruck listeners. The wild look faded from her eyes and she toppled over on her side in a faint. The priests set her upright again and the holy priest turned to Iemon and the rest of the assembly.</p>
<p>“You have heard the words of Iwa spoken through this woman. Hana was possessed by Iwa. That is why she had fallen into a trance…. Water, now!” </p>
<p>He made a series of passes over his patient with his hands.</p>
<p>“The trance has passed. You are no longer possessed by Iwa. The dishonored lady leaves you in peace. You are completely yourself again. You are convinced that Iwa was all an illusion. You believe that firmly, as I tell you to believe. Iwa does not haunt you. Iwa bears you no ill will.”</p>
<p>He looked Hana in the eyes intensely. His voice was clear and authoritative. Gently he began to stroke the back of her head, her neck, her spine.</p>
<p>“All is well?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! I am completely recovered. All is well.” </p>
<p>She let out a shallow sigh, sank back on the cushions, and, as everyone could see, fell quite naturally to sleep. The assembly was overjoyed and whispered their approval to one another. The priest addressed Iemon.</p>
<p>“I have done my part. You have all heard the words of Iwa. The rest is up to the temple. You must heed her words. And now, I must go.”</p>
<p>With his train of attendants chattering loudly behind him, he walked out front gate. The others who had been present swarmed along after them, leaving Iemon alone. He bit his thumbs in despondent rage. He was appalled at what had just happened.</p>
<p>“The old fox! What am I to do? I am too pressed for funds to take any action. If I refuse, I risk open hostility from the whole ward. Everyone is sure to turn against me. That miserable old swindler. He made it all up, he and his band of charlatans. The gods descend from above, the holy priest shakes the sacred staff from below—and those fools swallow it all at my expense!”</p>
<p>He did his best to put off making the costly request to the temple. Within a week, a committee from the ward came to accompany him. Iemon pretended as if had been expecting them and immediately complied. With four or five other gentlemen, then, he called on the Reverend Shūden, an illustrious priest from the temple of the Gyoran Kannon.</p>
<p>Kannon the all-merciful seemed the most fitting, given the circumstances. A word about this famous Buddhist saint seems in order, though I will spare you the full tale. Gyoran Kannon—the Fish-Basket Kannon—is also known by other names: the Stinking-Fish, the White-Robed, and the Fisherman’s Wife. A statue of the White-Robed Kannon still exists. It is carved in white wood, stained black, and shows a figure carrying a scroll in the right hand and a fish basket in the left. It is the story of Baryō and his connection with Kannon that is of interest to us here.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In Tang-dynasty China, there was a place called Kinshadan. Across the bay from Edo lies the province of Kazusa, composed of ninety-nine villages, one of which has the same name, Kinshadan. The fisherman there were reputed to be a rough lot. From infancy on, they did little but quarrel and fight over which bands control which wards of the village. Human relations among them were primitive at best. </p>
<p>Now one of the important challenges facing the fisherman was managing the catch of sardines. Pulling in the nets loaded with fish required the combined effort of the entire village—men, women, and even children. Among the workers assisting in the task, the people of Kinshadan took special notice of a young girl some sixteen or seventeen years old. It was not only her great beauty and her enchanting face and figure that caught their attention, but also the willingness and extraordinary strength she showed in handling the heavy nets. After she had lent a hand a number of times, some of the men finally approached her.</p>
<p>“Miss, you’re a stranger around these parts. We want to thank you for helping out. Who might you be and where do you come from? Strangers, even kind ones, must not keep their names hidden.” </p>
<p>The girl smiled.</p>
<p>“I come from Mt Potalaka in the South Sea…. Where is that? In India…. And where is India? In the South Sea.”</p>
<p>They marvelled at the thousands of miles she must have travelled.</p>
<p>“I have come to work for my husband.”</p>
<p>“Your husband? And, pray, who may that be in these parts?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t made up my mind yet,” answered the girl. “But let’s get on with it! The nets have been drawn and the fishing has ended for the day. I will climb that rock over there and recite the sutra of the Lady Kannon. The first of you to memorize it shall be my husband.”</p>
<p>It was not difficult for them to accept such an attractive proposal. The prospect of a beautiful helpmate who was endowed with surprising strength for someone so frail of form, and who seemed to bring good luck to the village in its struggle to make a living, was too much to pass up. Even their native prejudice against strangers paled in comparison with her qualifications.</p>
<p>The maid ascended her rostrum, and for three days she recited the holy sutra of Lady Kannon and expounded on its meaning. On the fourth day, one of the fisherman, a man named Baryō—a strapping and handsome young fellow—felt sure he was up to the test.</p>
<p>“Miss, please come down. Today I will recite the sutra and explain its meaning.”</p>
<p>The girl looked surprised but obeyed cheerfully. Baryō took her place on the rock. Without slipping once, he repeated the sutra word for word and held forth on the complexities of its meaning. The girl bowed low in acknowledgement.</p>
<p>“Please allow my humble presence to honor the hut of Baryō the fisherman. This night I shall soil a corner of your bedchamber.” </p>
<p>Baryō was jubilant as he led her directly to his home, where he hoped to fulfill the role of husband. At first she gently rebuked him.</p>
<p>“You rough people of Kinshadan have no regard for customs! We have first to carry out the rite of marriage. Saké cups are to be drained nine times by husband and wife. This seals the precious bond between them. There is etiquette to be observed between a man and a woman. Only when the conventions have been properly honored does a woman belong to a man, after which, she can never belong to anyone else.”</p>
<p>Thus was the rough fisherman taught the civilities of the marriage bed. Around dawn Baryō awoke in shock. His companion lay at his side dying. She was already unconscious and drenched in sweat. She seemed to be melting away. Suddenly she spit up a great heave of water and died. Baryō was beside himself. To lose his wife, and one who had just become his wife, one so beautiful, so strong—it was all too much</p>
<p>“This won’t do at all! Why has such a misfortune befallen me? Miss Kabe and Miss Nabe survived their marriage nights without mishap…. Yes, who’s there,” he called out in response to a knock at the door. </p>
<p>It was a friend who had stopped to look in on him.</p>
<p>“I can’t go out on the boats today…. As for the woman, she died on me. My wife is dead,” he explained.</p>
<p>As they were talking, a monk happened by. His attire was most unfamiliar. He approached them and inquired, “Is this the house of Baryō?” </p>
<p>They nodded.</p>
<p>“Has a young girl been by here?… What? She’s dead! Kindly let this foolish monk lay his eyes upon her.”</p>
<p>Baryō thought it was his turn for questions.</p>
<p>“And you? Where are you from?”</p>
<p>“Mt Potalaka in the South Sea.”</p>
<p>“Away with you, you prying fool,” Baryō blurted out, despondent and angry. “I’ve heard enough of Mt Potalaka. You are talking to a grieving widower. I must wait a month before seeking a new wife and I’ve still a long ways to go. But if you must, look.”</p>
<p>The humble attitude of the monk had a soothing effect on Baryō who walked over to raise the blanket from the woman’s body. He cried out in surprise.</p>
<p>“What do you know—she’s disappeared! There’s nothing here but a wooden image. And what a curious figure it is. She’s carrying a scroll and a fish basket, just like the ones my wife had with her at the beach. This is something one only reads about in books.”</p>
<p>He turned to the monk in astonishment, hoping for some explanation. The visitor replied emphatically in a sincere and noble voice.</p>
<p>“You have been blessed, Baryō. The Kannon of Mt Potalaka in the South Sea has appeared before your very eyes. She has given herself over to the embraces of a fisherman in order to teach a lesson to this wicked people and instruct them in holy writ. You must not think of marrying again. You have been called to forsake the world. Do not fail to obey.”</p>
<p>Baryō rushed to the door to catch a last glimpse of the stranger as he set off. In no time, all sign of the monk vanished from view. Baryō returned to the wooden figure lying where the body of the beautiful young girl had once lain in repose. It was a poor substitute for the flesh and blood he had once known, but he had made up his mind. He took his vows as a monk and shaved his head. Henceforth he would recite the sutra of the Lady Kannon and preach its wisdom.</p>
<p>That is how she came to be known as the Fish-Basket Kannon, the fisherman’s wife, in honor of her help in reforming the village of Kinshadan.</p>
<p>22 Memorial Rites for Iwa</p>
<p>Iemon fared as badly at the hands of the Buddha as he had at those of the gods. Reverend Shūden, as guardian of the sacred image of the Fish-Basket Kannon, was an illustrious man indeed. After some delay, the delegation from Samon-chō was ushered into his presence. Iemon bowed deeply in obeisance and explained the purpose of their visit. Iwa’s apparitions had caused a great commotion among the public. The priest’s assistance had being sought not out of personal interest but as a public service. On one hand, Iemon was seriously mistaken if he had any intentions of requesting funds from the temple treasury. On the other, those responsible for disturbing the peace, whatever form the disturbance happens to take, do not want to risk involving the authorities</p>
<p>Shūden inquired in minute detail as to the visit of the Shinto priest, of which word had reached him. Whatever information Iemon attempted to withhold or minimize, or otherwise paint in a different light, was offset by others in the delegation who were only too willing to cooperate by correcting and expanding on the ambiguities of their spokesman’s account.</p>
<p>Shūden listened to Iemon with a gravity and a look on his face wavering between calculated judgment and cynical incredulity. He turned towards the committee, with particular attention to those offering glosses on Iemon’s oratory. He nodded his head thoughtfully in agreement with the rival priest, whose insight he held in high regard. Memorial services were to be performed over the year. For one thing, it was a way of providing restitution to the victim. For another, Iwa’s wandering spirit had to be properly contained. That was the more difficult task. If sutras were recited for seven continuous days and the substitute corpse were laid to rest without any possibility of being disturbed, the spirit of the enraged woman would be conjured into submission and the curse of having died without a proper memorial would be lifted. For the burial itself, an internode of bamboo twenty inches in length was to be placed in the casket.</p>
<p>Once informed of the priest’s decision, Iemon and his companions withdrew. He was resigned to paying the fifty ryō needed to cover the cost of memorial services for a year. The bamboo was another matter. The task of finding a section of bamboo just the right length was about as easy as fishing for black pearls. He soon realized that securing a substitute corpse and securing the bamboo were actually the same thing.</p>
<p>After examining all the bamboo that had found its way into the secular world of Edo, where it was available for a surprisingly low price, the committee returned to the world of the sacred. They soon discovered that the article in question was in stock only at the Hall of the Fish-Basket Kannon. On entering the temple offices, Iemon felt as if the somber greetings of the official, who directed him to the treasury, were only a mask to conceal a profound contempt. He was sure of it once he was told that so rare an object could be had, but only at an additional fifty ryō. The temple did not accept credit. Suzuki the usurer, who just happened to be tagging along, hemmed and hawed before consenting to hand over the money, the very amount he had just received from Akiyama Shōzaemon as a bounty for the sale of their daughter Tsuru into service. Reluctantly, the long-nosed, long-faced, lanky Kamimura agreed to insure repayment upon returning to the ward. With a cheery recklessness, Iemon had just dispensed with his last hope of any income from the pension and resources of the Tamiya house for the next three years. That is how heavily he was in debt.</p>
<p>Shūden, for his part, wasted no time. With at least one member of the committee in attendance to guarantee that the conditions of the agreement were being met, sutras were chanted for seven days by the loudest and most abrasive of the monks, backed up by the entire community of Shūden’s monks. Periodically throughout the day and night, one of the monks would slip over to a side altar, to invoke the Buddha’s mercy on the wandering spirit of the dead lady. A few short words spoken in haste, and then he was back to spend the rest of the vigil in decorous, immobile slumber.</p>
<p>When the seven days of recitation were up, a procession was prepared. Six men outfitted in new uniforms provided them by Iemon pretended to labor under the weight of the long oblong chest. Four men carried a ritual white wooden stand on which rested the bamboo tube that Shūden himself wrapped in a scroll of the sacred Kannon Sutra. The officials of the ward were in attendance. Ordinary citizens turned out en masse. It had been a long time since Yotsuya had witnessed such a spectacle. The residences of the nobility within its precincts were conspicuously unrepresented. Long lines of their spearman, attendants, samurai, and officials were only visible at times on the highway that leads away from Shinjuku to the Kōshū Kaidō Road and the alternate, but little travelled, Ashigaratōge Pass. </p>
<p>When the procession had reached Samon-chō, Shūden inspected the ground selected for burial. The prelate’s eyebrows puckered to show his misgivings.</p>
<p>“There are too many people buried here. Is there no place else?”</p>
<p>He was led him to another site, but his face only deepened into a frown.</p>
<p>“There are too many children here. Their frolicking and instincts are unbecoming. It would only outrage the fragile spirit of the deceased. Any other place?”</p>
<p>The committee was baffled. Iemon was seriously afraid that all his efforts and all the expense he had gone to would do no more than fatten up Shuden’s coffers. A thought struck him.</p>
<p>“There may be no more open land, but our garden at the Tamiya house is secluded and has plenty of space. It is walled off from public access.”</p>
<p>People looked at him aghast. He was either insanely courageous or stubbornly skeptical of the powers Iwa had so plainly manifested. Shūden paid no attention to their whispering.</p>
<p>“Lead the way.”</p>
<p>The procession wended its way back to Tera-machi and through the gates of the Tamiya house. A spot just in front of the garden gate was decided on. It would be visible to passsersby who might wish to say a prayer or pay their respects and yet remain cut off from outside access. On Shūden’s order a hole was dug four feet deep. He began to chant a sutra while his monks stood by attentively. As the last word of the text echoed off the prelate’s lips, they took the bamboo tube with its sutra wrapping and slid it into the long chest. With a sharp click, the lock snapped shut. Everyone was deeply impressed. Shūden remained in prayer and meditation for a respectable period of time.</p>
<p>“The purification is complete. Iwa no longer roams about doing penance and wreaking havoc on the living. Anyone who says otherwise from here on in does not speak the truth. Mark my words. Keep such people away from you and do not let children turn this site into a playground. You have been warned. Those who fail to heed my admonition are sure to be defiled. Their ways are perverse and insulting to the dead. Parents carrying infants on their backs are especially enjoined to stay away.”</p>
<p>He tied a piece of paper inscribed with Sanskrit characters to a bamboo stick and placed it on a white wooden slat. On it he brushed similar lettering to create the appearance of a genuine stupa. Neither he nor any of those present had any idea what he had written or cared a whit about such essential sacred matters. After giving and receiving the appropriate courtesies, the priest and his band of monks gathered up their gowns and scampered out the gate, a clear display of how much temples and shrines differ in their dealings with the secular world. The crowd following the funeral dispersed, greatly edified by what they had witnessed and murmuring among themselves about the dilapidated state of the Tamiya home and how far it had fallen from the immaculate upkeep of former days.</p>
<p>“Let a spendthrift in the door and your wealth will leak from every crack. How it must pain the spirit of Tamiya Matazaemon to have to watch this. Why did he ever take in a stranger as a son-in-law?”</p>
<p>Iemon flattered himself on how well the sacred intervention had worked out The mind of the public was put at ease and nothing more was heard of Iwa. The only thing that still troubled him was the daily summons to the ward on one pretext or another. The ward officials had also made a practice of stopping by the Tamiya house en route to their performance of duties elsewhere. He knew that this meant he was being watched. He went over in his head everything the Yotsuya district might know about his past. There was nothing there to arouse suspicion. No allegations could be pursued, he told himself, if their case rested on a ghost story. (The famous investigation of Ōoka Tadasuke, the governor of Echizen belonged to a later day.)</p>
<p>Hana’s improvement also helped to lighten his stress. Ever since the Shinto priest had beguiled her and impressed his will on her own, the devoted object of Iemon’s unwavering affection had begun to get better by the day. She had now returned to her normal self: a bit thinner and mentally exhausted, but at least in her right mind. To him she remained a beautiful memory of the past and as beautiful as ever in the present.</p>
<p>Two weeks had passed since Shuden’s ritual experiment. One night around nine o-clock there came a knock at the door. Hana rose from her sewing.</p>
<p>“Iemon, Kamimura would like a word with you.”</p>
<p>Her husband brushed his hand aside in annoyance. The lanky pest had been shadowing him ever since he had put up the bail for the loan from Suzuki. Iemon went to the door and stared in amazement. There stood Kamimura, his hair in a tousle, without a stitch on him except for his wife’s loincloth—and she was almost a dwarf. He reached out a hand to Iemon, half threatening, half begging.</p>
<p>“Iemon, a word. I need hard coin, not promises. Please, ten ryō. Suzuki the moneylender has come after me to collect on the bond I put up to secure the loan you took to pay for the funeral. He came to our house today and stripped us of everything. My wife and children have to go hungry and sleep nearly naked on the floorboards. When I pleaded for mercy and asked that he come to you, the wretched shark just sneered at me.</p>
<p>“‘Go to Tamiya? He doesn’t have anything left but a brazier, three tatami mats, and the clothes on his back and his wife’s. Their house and land are all part of the family inheritance. I wouldn’t get anything out of it but a lawsuit, which would not even cover the paperwork. But you are a rich man with a well-stocked house. One word to the authorities and my debt and expenses are all squared away. So why bother with the Tamiya?’</p>
<p>“And then he marched off, ridiculing me. Please, Iemon, I need you to return what you owe. At least give me enough for clothes and shelter and something to eat.”</p>
<p>Iemon just stood there speechless. Ten ryō! He might as well have asked for ten thousand. The house and land were secure. They belonged to the trust of the Tamiya family for as long as the house maintained its status. His pension had been mortgaged out a long time ago and the farms were gone. Kamimura’s troubles saddened him, but he had to refuse, softening the blow with vague promises about the near future. He would take out another loan to cover the debt to Suzuki in full, and then Kamimura’s possessions would all be restored. Goemon could see right through him. He shook his fist at Iemon and gave him a verbal thrashing.</p>
<p>“Shame has come to the house of Kamimura and misery has been visited on our family, all at the hands of this vile outsider. It is you and your heartless, hateful treatment of Iwa that have brought distress and disaster on the ward. So what if I am without food or clothing now? Bide your time until I return to taken revenge against you and your house.”</p>
<p>Iemon tried to get him to calm down, at least enough to get some indication of how he planned to harm him. Goemon shook him off like a snake. With a wild laugh he stomped away, naked as he was, into the dark of the night. He had no clear idea where he was going or what he would do. But as he passed the garden gate of the Tamiya home, his eye caught the counterfeit stupa shining white under the flickering light of the moon. He stood stock-still, and then clapped his hands in a fit of joy and resolve. He hastened home and looked around for his old battered axe and rusty spade. Soon he was back at the garden gate. One blow and the crossbar gave way. Goemon stepped inside.</p>
<p>“She is only four feet under. That should be easy enough. No one’s around at this hour.”</p>
<p>His arms dug in nervously and the dirt flew. In no time he had casket up on the ground beside him. Thunder peeled in the distance. He would have to hurry now or get drenched in the approaching storm. He laughed out loud. What has a naked man to fear from getting wet? His clothes can hardly rot or shrink on him. Why don’t people just go around in bath towels all the time, just enough to dry them off when necessary? He opened the chest and his eyes fell on the bamboo tube wrapped in a scroll. The first few drops of rain fell on his bare shoulders, but he paid no attention.</p>
<p>“This is heavy! I doubt that Iwa weighed more than this when she was alive. Lady Tamiya, have mercy on me. Iemon and Hana, those evil degenerates, thrive and prosper, while I am driven to poverty and starvation. Let the wrath of Iwa fall on these vile wretches. I set you free to find them and kill them.”</p>
<p>He picked up the axe, and raising it over his head, brought it down forcefully on the bamboo tube. At that moment a violent peal of thunder broke, rolling off into the distance crashing and rattling. The landscape was lit up brightly by a bolt of lightning. People turned over uneasily in their beds.</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn Iemon woke with a start to a pounding sound at the door. Hana could only make out muffled voices outside the rain shutters. Iemon returned to the room. His face was white and he staggered as he walked across the room to slip on a robe. He was too agitated to answer her questions with more than a word or two. His one thought was to keep from her hearing what he had just learned.</p>
<p>He found his men from the ward gathered around in the garden. They stood there in shock and confusion, looking at one another and then at the broken bamboo tube. Close by lay the body of the man who had done the deed, his brains and blood oozing from a hole in his skull where the sharp end of the axe had sunk in deeply. It appeared as if it had rebounded from the hard surface of the bamboo. One of the bystanders pointed out a tiny crack near the node. It was hardly a scratch, but more than enough to be the assailant’s undoing. Iemon approached to examine the body.</p>
<p>“Why, it’s Goemon!”</p>
<p>He answered their puzzled looks by recounting how Kamimura had called him on the previous night and how he left in a rage at Iemon’s inability to aid him in his time of need. They hung their heads low and turned to go home, eyes on the ground and tongues wagging. The neighbors carried Goemon’s body to his house. Iemon picked up the tube of bamboo and placed it in a closet. It was as expensive an item as they had ever owned. He was overcome with desperation.</p>
<p>Later that same day, at three o’clock in the afternoon, Hana heard a call from the front door. </p>
<p>“If you please.” </p>
<p>She flinched at the sight of a beggar standing at the entrance. His body was shrouded in a grubby straw mat, his bandaged feet and arms protruding like some hideous insect emerging from its shell. His face was wrapped in a towel as if to hide the all too obvious signs of leprosy </p>
<p>“What do want with us? We have nothing for you. Kindly leave at once.” </p>
<p>His voice was rasping as he struggled to get the words out.</p>
<p> “I have a request for Master Iemon. Please inform him.”</p>
<p>Hana shrank back into the house with a frightened look on her face. Iemon saw that she was trembling and jumped to his feet.</p>
<p>“You say it was a beggar that frightened you? Such people are to be dealt with severely.” He went to the entrance.</p>
<p>“A beggar, and someone the likes of you? How did you ever make it into the ward? There is nothing for you here. If you want to avoid the dogs and a good caning, I suggest you leave at once.” </p>
<p>The man did not stir from the spot. Slowly he loosened the matting from around his body, the kind made of coarse straw used to wrap saké barrels. He was dressed in rags held together by the foul discharge seeping out of his open sores. Then he removed the towel from his face. The ghastly white and red blotches, the livid scars of the leper, the head with patches of scurfy hair ready to fall out at a touch, startled even the former priest. He would gladly have forfeited all the wealth the Tamiya family had accumulated over the years rather than touch this man or have him around. The visitor noticed the effect he was having on Iemon.</p>
<p>“What you see before you is what Iwa’s wrath has made of Chōbei. Don’t you recognize me, your old neighbor who knew you back when you went by the name of Kazuma? Everything that has happened is because of you. My wife and child and my livelihood have all been taken from me. While I was in jail, I was robbed of everything I had. And this is what is left of me, decaying in body and soul. I seek refuge at nights under the carts of the street vendors, and on cold, wet nights, in the mouth of some sewage drain. I consider it my lucky day when the weather permits me to seek rest by the river bank. I look for rest, but I don’t find it. Iwa is ever at my side. No sooner do my eyelids drop than I am aroused again to see her face close up and glaring into mine. I pleaded, I begged, but I was not to be forgiven: </p>
<p>“‘You owe me, and you will pay it back by suffering, but never what I, Iwa, have suffered. Forget about rest.’ </p>
<p>“My daughter, the one who I sold some time ago to the Yamadaya in Yoshiwara, gave me some support, She grew up in that brothel to become a profitable resource. Through the considerable influence of one of the courtesans, I was granted entrance and for a night was given a bed and something to eat. But that same night Kihei showed up. He killed his courtesan lover, crushed her like a bug. I nearly died, but Kihei left me to the mercy of Iwa. Some mercy!” </p>
<p>He tried to raise his arms in a weary gesture of despair, but the pain of the effort was too great. He moaned.</p>
<p>“Last night I decided to put an end to it. For years the Ryōgoku­bashi Bridge has carried pedestrians to and fro and offered final solace for the dregs of humanity. As I stood on it, the dark waters seemed to call to me as they swept mightily out to sea. In a moment it could all be over. I was about to throw myself in when I felt a hand on my shoulder. It dragged me back. I turned around and there stood Iwa. The creature looked more foul than she had in life, with her sagging eyelids, her bald head and savage look. She spoke to me.</p>
<p>“‘So you want to end it all. You think salvation lies before you. But you will not die without my say so. Go to Yotsuya, to Iemon and Hana who live in luxury at the Tamiya house. They will not refuse you help.’ </p>
<p>“It was she who led me here. Answer my prayer. Help me die in Yotsuya, reclining on tatami and not on the cold earth only to be cast out on the swamp for the dogs to devour. Let me be buried on the temple grounds.”</p>
<p>His feeble quivering hands clasped his stomach and he changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Oh, this aching hunger. I am tormented in body as well as spirit. I plead for food and alms, but people turn away from the leper I have become. Look, I have only two fingers left on my hand. I count them off and there is one more left to whom I can beg. Hana, please, a ball of rice. At least you have never known the pangs of hunger…. You are still possessed of that beauty and charm for which Iemon has brought ruin upon us all.” </p>
<p>Hana fled the horrible and lascivious leer of this thing standing at their door. Iemon, now alone, had been thinking.</p>
<p>“What you say is right. You are entitled to my help. You shall die here on a mat, but not in your present condition. Go and get yourself clothes suitable for appearing in public. Take a bath and wash your pus-covered body. Then come back. We will give you the relief you seek, Chōbei.” </p>
<p>He wrapped a ryō in a strip of paper and passed it to the leper. It was the last coin he owned. Hana now returned with five or six salted rice balls. The two of them watched in revulsion as his horrendously diseased stumps awkwardly shoved the food into his toothless mouth, cramming it in and breaking it up so as savor every last grain.</p>
<p>“Until tomorrow,” said Chōbei. </p>
<p>He picked up his walking stick. Hana and Iemon watched silently until he had left.</p>
<p>“He just crawled away leaning on his bamboo staff like some insect.” </p>
<p>Hana looked at Iemon expecting some reply, but he just turned his head away.</p>
<p>Chōbei made his way through the twilight across the Ryōgoku­bashi Bridge. Take’s words had come true. He had the feeling he was being followed. At the sound of footsteps he looked behind him and spotted a samurai wearing a hooded hat. Without thinking, he stretched out his hands and leaned toward the roadway, hoping for alms. The man pulled back and passed him by hastily in disgust. Chōbei carried on aimlessly. He was surprised to find himself on the embankment the North Warigesui Canal, where he would often come of late. He looked down at the nauseous spot where Iwa had first vanished.</p>
<p>“I have come to a foul end, but an end nonetheless. One night, that’s all I ask. One night’s sleep. Lady of Tamiya, forgive me and grant me this small respite. Even just one hour of sleep.” </p>
<p>He carefully adjusted his straw mat and laboriously stretched himself out.</p>
<p>“I will die on a mat, that was what Iemon said,” he thought to himself as he felt his rags. “It was a good thing he agreed. I had other ways to force him to comply. Well, that’s for later.” </p>
<p>A rustling sound aroused him. Someone was shuffling cautiously through the dry grass of the past winter and creeping his way. He sat up. Realizing that he had been discovered, the man rushed on him. Chōbei struggled to his feet as if prepared to fight for his life.</p>
<p>“Life is precious. Why kill Chōbei the leper? To try out a new sword? Pardon me, but my flesh is too rotten and it will only defile your weapon. I was once a samurai. I know…. Oh, is there to be no relief? It’s Iemon, come to kill me!”</p>
<p>He shouted the name again and then again in desperation. Afraid that someone might be listening and find him out, Iemon did not delay. The gleam of his weapon lashed downward. Iemon seemed uncertain as he stood over the body. He bent down and thought to have a look, but he could not bring himself to touch those foul rags. A certain delicacy of temperament, almost womanlike, made him recoil. Besides, what more did he have to do with Chōbei the leper? Their accounts were closed. Should he leave the body where it was? If someone were to recognize who it was, it might come back to him. </p>
<p>He looked around for some way to sink the body in the canal without having to touch the repulsive remains. An empty barrel used for soy sauce caught his eye on the bank. It was old but still fairly intact. He rolled it over and gingerly wrapped his shoulder sash around the corpse, fastening it firmly around the girth of the barrel. He filled the barrel with stones, pushed in the head, and sent it rolling with its freight into the Warigesui.</p>
<p>“That’ll hold him down, the rotten thug! Three days and no one will be able to recognize him any more.” </p>
<p>He set off at a quick pace for Yotsuya.</p>
<p>23 No Bridge over the Sanzu no Kawa</p>
<p>It was nine o’clock by the time Iemon reached his house in Yotsuya. To his surprise he found the rain shutters that opened on to the garden still open. Someone was lying face down in the hallway. It was Hana. He asked her what was wrong and she answered haltingly, as if trying to suppress an excruciating pain. </p>
<p>“I don’t know. I was opening a cabinet to take out some spices in preparation for dinner when a rat sprang out. It scratched me on the face and the pain is terrible.” </p>
<p>She groaned and Iemon gently raised her up. The look on his face alarmed her.</p>
<p>“There’s a hand-mirror on the vanity. Please get it for me.” </p>
<p>The mirror had been part of Iwa’s dowry. He hesitated and tried to calm her instead.</p>
<p>“Let it be. Your wounds will heal soon enough and the pain will pass.”</p>
<p>She pushed him aside and ran to the vanity. She brought the mirror over to the single lamp lighting the room. What she saw left her horror-struck. One side of her face was completely discolored. It was a dark red, almost black. The mark of five fingers was plainly visible, as if she had been slapped. Clearly no rat had done this. Hana dropped her head down almost to her knees. Iemon put a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Never mind, Hana. The pain will be gone by first light.”</p>
<p>Her head lifted and he recoiled at the angry scowl facing him.</p>
<p>“Well, well, if it isn’t Iemon! How easy it was for you to get hold of everything I owned and waste it on your Hana. As easy as picking up a handful of wet grain. And then, barbarian that you are, you sold me into the vile life of a street whore. Revenge is mine!” </p>
<p>Iemon stepped back terrified. Hana’s madness had returned; she thought she was Iwa again. She jumped up and began to tear at the papered doors. Then she turned on him, the heavy mirror in hand, as if seeking revenge for some imaginary wrong. Iemon narrowly escaped injury as he pounced on her and tried to hold her down. He dragged her away from the lamp and the two of them wrestled in the half-lit room. The temporary strength of the poor sick woman soon gave out and he pinned down her on the floor like a vanquished foe. She fell back to sleep, almost unconscious, and he let go of her. He crept over to the closet where he had hidden the bamboo tube and placed the hand-mirror alongside it.</p>
<p>He watched over her through the night. When daylight came, he was exhausted and sought the help of a nurse, who at once obliged. He had just drifted away to sleep when the nurse awakened him in alarm. Hana was running a high fever and raving wildly. There was no restraining her. Her cries were chilling but no more than the words that fell from her lips.</p>
<p>“Iwa, forgive me! I used the potions from Suian to afflict you in mind and body. I set out to poison your life at the roots and cut you off from all hope of offspring. Oh, the conceit of a man’s love! You give him everything you have, your possessions and your very body, and what does he do? He sells you for a streetwalker. Get rid of him!… And Kaiho, rotten to the core, steps up to help. What a dreadful sight he is now, with those huge empty sockets for eyes, with the purplish white flesh all chewed up and eaten. Oh, the stench! But no, it’s not Kaiho at all, It’s Chōbei, Chōbei the leper who wanted to take me in his embrace…. Iemon is coming. There is murder in his eyes. I can see him but Chōbei can’t. Run away!… Ah, there she is again!”</p>
<p>She grabbed the nurse by the arm and pointed to the night lamp that had just been lit. It gave off a faint light, barely enough to clear the approaching dark of night. Was it her imagination? There, in dim outline, sat Iwa. Her hair hung down against the silhouette of her face and shoulders. There was no mistaking the bulging forehead and puffy eyelids. The nurse shook free of her patient’s hand and fled the house. Iemon did not try to stop her. He was petrified. He had seen it, too, and was convinced it was true.</p>
<p>Anxious and wearied, he stood watch through the night. Earlier that day, a police constable came by with a summons for Iemon to present himself the next day at the office of Katada Tatewaki. His lordship had some questions to ask and under no circumstances was the request to be ignored. Hana had fallen into a cataleptic state. Around one o’clock in the morning, he decided to clear his mind and take a few minutes to relax. His head barely touched the pillow before he fell asleep. </p>
<p>The bell of the Kenshō-ji temple struck the hour, its loud clang echoing throughout the house. Iemon awoke to feel himself being held down, as if his whole body were suffocating. He opened his eyes, and there was the broad, white, flat face of Iwa. Her eyes were animated and flashing fire from deep within their swollen sockets. He could feel her wild and disheveled hair sweep across his face as she swayed gently from side to side, her hands clutching tightly to his chest.</p>
<p>“So now you recognize Iwa, Iemon. So does Hana. I am sworn to take and kill you both for your next seven lives. Come, then. It is time for me to carry out my revenge.” </p>
<p>She was still shaking him and pressing down on him as he gradually awakened from his sleep. He pushed her back with a shout and jumped up to grab the sword near his pillow. In a mad flurry of blows he slashed again and again at the figure before him. The groaning that answered him back only spurred him on.</p>
<p>A ruckus outside the house brought Iemon back to his senses. He could hear a loud knocking at the gate. He hastily trimmed the lamp and turned it toward the body. It was Hana! He leaned on his bloodsoaked sword and bent over her. Large drops of cold sweat formed on his forehead. Then a voice shouted from outside.</p>
<p>“In his lordship’s name, open the door or we will use force!” </p>
<p>Why had time for the summons been moved up? The ill-fated ravings of Hana flashed through his mind and he could no longer think straight. There was a devious look in his eyes. He quietly made his way over to the rain shutters that opened onto the garden. There was no one there. He could escape undetected in the rainstorm. As he crept through the shadows, he noticed someone posted at the back gate. He leaped on to the roof of the shed and looked over into Tera-machi. It was deserted. With his sword, still covered in gore, he hacked off the sharp ends of the bamboo restraining spikes so he could slide across them and over the wall. He threw his weapon to one side and in a matter of minutes had vanished down the street. </p>
<p>When Katada Tatewaki and his men finally managed to break their way through the sturdy outer door of the Tamiya house, they found the place empty, except for the body of Hana lying in a pool of blood. The corpse was still warm. It looked like a clear case of murder and Katada issued an urgent order to track down the villain. He searched the house methodically, right down to the rubbish pile, which was still sealed—no doubt an important detail. He grinned suspiciously when he came upon the broken bamboo tube hidden in the closet. This he kept from his men.</p>
<p>Where did Iemon go? Not even the wretched man himself could remember everything that happened in the following days. He came to on a dark a spring night, just before the dawn. The stars were beginning to dim in the eastern sky and the landscape was bathed in a livid, eerie twilight hovering uncertainly between night and day. Iemon looked around in surprise and then began to shiver all over. The stagnant waters of Warigesui’s fetid canal lay beneath him. He had come to rest at the very spot on the bank where he had disposed of Chōbei. He recalled the old poem:</p>
<p>On the Sanzu no Kawa,</p>
<p>There are no hills or bridges.</p>
<p>On this crossway for the dead</p>
<p>Not one flower blooms.</p>
<p>He understood that the hills referred to Yamada Chōbei; the bridges, to himself, Takahashi Iemon; and the flowers to his wife Hana.</p>
<p>There was nowhere for Iemon to go. His course was run and he knew it. But how should he end his life? He was an outright coward at heart. When he drew his dagger to plunge it into his bowels, he froze at the sight of the steel. Better the green slime of the waters below, he thought to himself and slipped the blade back into its sheath. He stared down gloomily and gave an idle kick at a small rock on the ground. It dislodged, wobbled, and then rolled sluggishly down the bank, plunging into the stream with a splash before sinking into its silent depths. His eyes had been following but were not prepared for what happened next. He let out a cry of horror and bent over the stream with his arms raised high. His hair stood on end he watched a hideous object float to the surface. The face of Chōbei, all purple and bloated, its lips half chewed away and parted in a fiendish grin, stared up at him. Iemon dropped his arms and covered his face with his hands to shut out the ghastly spectacle. </p>
<p>Morbid curiosity soon got the better of him and he drew his hands aside for another look. Had he gone mad? The barrel turned slowly around to reveal the wide, flat face, the bulging brow and heavy lids, the tangled, disheveled hair of the drowned body of Iwa. The night air reverberated with his feverish screams. In these waters? Is this where I am to die? No, no, a thousand times—no! He turned to run but his legs would not obey him. With mortal resolve he pulled his blade from its sheath and tore open his robes to make the deadly thrust. As he raised his dagger, an invisible hand seized him by the arm. When he struggled to free himself, his other arm was taken hold of. The hands seemed to be coming from all sides and holding him fast. He raged and shook and struggled frantically to elude their grasp. Finally he gave in and fainted.</p>
<p>Katada Tatewaki had been watching his men wrestle with Iemon from atop the bank. He stepped down and looked at the bound and helpless creature.</p>
<p>“It’s him, no doubt about it.” </p>
<p>At his orders, a bamboo pole was brought around and run through the cords binding Iemon’s hands and feet. Like an animal carried back from the hunt, he was taken to the nearest ward office. The formalities were simple and soon over with. To avoid any repetition of the scene at his arrest, they took him away just as he was. His brutal transport across Edo took place in full daylight. People turned and stared at the entourage and their captured prey. From a distance, they took it for a wild boar or one of those mischievous raccoon-like tanuki. On drawing closer, they realized it was a man. Any attempt he made to jostle free of his restraints was met with the prick of a spear, painful but restrained enough to avoid serious injury. </p>
<p>As violent as his resistance was, it is doubtful they could have walked him the distance. After his escape Iemon had never stopped to rest, nor had those in his pursuit, even though they had not expected to catch up with him. A wider net was being cast over the Yotsuya affair. Tamiya Yoemon and Kondō Rokurobei were under investigation. The death of the young girl Haru at Tōemon’s brothel in Honjo had unforeseen consequences. During the interrogations that followed, one of the women, Take, had made a full confession. Mobei the peddler had never left the brothel or managed to escape the wiles of Matsu. The sight of his goods had aroused her greed. She had him poisoned and buried in the garden. </p>
<p>Haru knew what had happened and that was what had her killed. Both Tōemon’s wife Matsu and her understudy Kin despised Haru. The remnants of her early beauty and her youth gave her influence with the master of the house. The two women preyed on his fears until he consented to her elimination. On a quickly trumped-up charge, she was dragged off to the disciplinary shed for punishment. After three days of torture at the hands of Matsu and Kin, she died of her injuries without having been able to let her friend Take in on her secret. </p>
<p>The Honjo police set to work promptly, but not prompt enough to forestall Kim’s disappearance from Edo, which in itself they took to be a confession of guilt. The prayer beads found in the hands of the chief priest of the Reigan-ji temple were easily traced back to Matsu herself. For his part, Tōemon held out as long as he could but eventually died under interrogation. When Matsu at last confessed, the full story of Iwa’s connection with Tōemon and his house came to light. Nothing further need be said of her. She rotted in jail and died there. The girls were dispersed to other brothels. Two of the women, out on the prowl in the residential district along the Warigesui, had witnessed the murder of Chōbei three nights before. The police notified Tatewaki who accompanied them to retrieve the body. To everyone’s surprise, they found Iemon, the object of their all-put pursuit, on that very spot.</p>
<p>The investigation kept on widening in scope until it came to the source of all the trouble. In the course of the procedures, Tatewaki had handed the Tamiya case over to the jurisdiction of the commissioner of the northern district of Edo, a certain Honma Iga no Kami. The two magistrates together poured intently over the mountain of documents that had piled up in the case. Old Tamiya Yoemon proved easy game. He willingly confessed everything he knew. His testimony led to numerous other witnesses from the ward, but their “evidence” was not as useful as they had hoped it would be. It was mostly based on hearsay and conjecture, but to be fair, at the time such testimony was valued not much less than firsthand accounts. </p>
<p>Everything pointed to the real criminal, their star witness in the case. At first, there was little to implicate Yoemon. But he was unable to hold his tongue once he started ranting about Iemon and Kondō. (Akiyama was out of reach.) The faces of the magistrates grew stern as the role of Suzuki the moneylender became clear. The very idea: lending money to a samurai with interest, and then forcing his debtors into financial ruin in order to recoup his losses! The miserly, greedy Yoemon was discovered to have been behind it, until his own losses became so great that he had to take out a loan himself, leaving him at the mercy of his former partner. Yoemon, together with his co-conspirators, had not been party to Suzuki’s schemes for restitution and as a result the old man was not dealt with severely. He was remanded in custody but, upon posting bail, was ordered confined to a room in his house.</p>
<p>Rokurobei was eventually shown some leniency as well. When at first he proved recalcitrant and less than truthful, Iga no Kami signalled for the constables, who rushed in with their dreaded instruments: two-foot long, narrow strips of bamboo tightly wrapped with twisted hemp an inch thick. The mere sight of it brought Kondō to his senses. On entering, he had seen a commoner being led away after undergoing punishment. The image of the man’s back, a mass of bruised and bleeding flesh, was still vivid in his mind. He prostrated himself at once and made a full confession. </p>
<p>At last they had come to the real heart of the matter. Kondō was a firsthand witness to the facts and was able to detail from start to finish the whole plot against Iwa that had brought such misfortune upon Yotsuya. His story began with Iemon’s arrival in the ward and carried all the way to the discovery of Kamikura Goemon’s body. Chōbei’s role was not entirely clear to him. He pleaded ignorance as the handing over of Iwa to the master of the nighthawks in Honjo. Tatewaki grinned as he went along with him on that point. He already knew. Despite his cooperation, Kondō was sent back to jail. He had unquestionably been one of the principal players. </p>
<p>Finally, it was Iemon’s turn. Some weeks had passed since his capture. His body had been dutifully nursed back to health, but his mind was in an awful state. The evil agenda of the jail keepers in reinvigorating their captive so that they might more effectively torture him later into confessing was somewhat frustrated by the nocturnal visions of the poor wretch. The two hags Iwa and Mino, along with the purple, bloated remains of Chōbei, hounded and tormented him night after night. Oh, to sleep! If he could only close his eyes to these horrors! But they only became more and more vivid. </p>
<p>The jailors moved him to the farthest corner of the expansive compound. Those of his fellow prisoners that were allowed into the yard beat on him and tore into him verbally for the disturbances he was causing at night. In spite of it all, Iemon kept his wits about him. He may have been trapped, but in his more lucid moments, he realized that there was little the authorities could hold against him. Iwa? Not even in Tokugawa times could one be prosecuted on supernatural grounds, except at the hands of the vulgar rabble. In those days, a wife had no more legal recourse against abuse by her husband or in-laws than she does in our own Taishō era. As for Chōbei, he was dead and gone. The fact that Iemon had been present on the scene was not sufficient evidence to hold him for murder. His only misgivings in that regard lay in his confused state of mind during those days. Even so, who would blame a samurai for testing his blade on a beggar? What else were beggars good for? </p>
<p>He knew nothing of the evidence Yoemon and Kondō had given and the proof that lay in the hands of Katada. He had wholly forgotten the nurse who had listened to the wild ravings of Hana in her illness, broken sentences that bore so heavily on and dovetailed so nicely into the case as a whole. It was because of her that Tatewaki had decided not to wait for Iemon to show up at the appointed hour. </p>
<p>Iemon also forgot to take into account the characters of the two men before whom he was to appear. Iga no Kami sat as judge in the case. Close beside him, a little in the rear, sat Katada Tatewaki, in whose jurisdiction the case had originated, and who was familiar with every stage of the proceedings. The four constables sat on either side of them. Iga no Kami and Katada were typical of their class. Cold, callous, cruel, and devoted to the letter of the samurai code. With the exception of the high regard they had for certain virtues esteemed among the commoners, such as filial respect and unswerving obedience to one’s superior, they were not given to treat intruders into their class kindly. Iemon had brought shame on the samurai. Hence the serious character of the charges and the need for careful scrutiny. </p>
<p>Iga no Kami agreed to Tatewaki’s suggestions for prosecuting the case. Iemon had only been thinking of the murder of Chōbei, the abuse of his wife Iwa, and the conspiracy against her life and honor. But the first question put to him would be enough to cripple his defence: Was he not the son of Takahashi Daihachirō? The whole disastrous panorama of consequences that would come from admitting to that one fact were clear to Tatewaki from his own experience as a constable. The Takahashi family had been stripped of its rank and degraded to a lower social class. Properly speaking, this made Iemon an intruder, a samurai impostor. This was an offence against the sovereign lord, the Shōgun himself. The full weight of the punishment for treason hung over him. That said, Tatewaki had been quick to see the advantage of disassociating the case from Iemon’s pretence to samurai status. He would be treated as a simple commoner and a charlatan who had insulted the authorities. </p>
<p>Iemon stumbled badly in his own defense and there was no delay in making him pay for it. One of the officials took hold of the restraining ropes and pulled Iemon’s head down to the ground; the others held his body immobile. A few carefully chosen stout jailers stepped forward. Their blows fell rhythmically and ferociously. First the welts appeared, and soon after, blood was trickling from the torn flesh. No sign was given them to let up. At the seventieth blow, the body collapsed in a faint. He was a pathetic sight. The jail staff who witnessed the infliction of double the usual number of stripes had rarely seen such severe punishment. The jailors hated the oily, smooth-talking disturber of their peace. They were running a jail, not a madhouse. Their superiors had no intention of showing him the mercy of further questioning. They were satisfied that his nightly ravings would be reduced to the subdued groans of the chastised.</p>
<p>As the days passed, his body healed, although movement was still difficult and painful. When he was dragged again before the magistrates, the very memory of his earlier scourging was enough to make him scream out his answers. Questioned again regarding his conspiracy against the samurai class, he was too terrified to admit to his fraudulent attempt to consummate marriage with a samurai woman (the actual facts and legality of the charge were ignored), his mistreatment of her, and his eventual sale of her into service. He had thought the worst they could do to him was banish him from Edo, but now he realized that his best hope for a merciful end would be decapitation. He pleaded with them for a quick and painless death. Once again, he was beaten to a pulp but clung to his denial. Still, the matter was too important to end there. </p>
<p>At his next appearance, he was seized and bound to a post fixed in the ground not far from the judge’s seat. His knees were pressed down on a grid of triangular bars that blunted the flogging just enough to keep from breaking the skin. He was not spared any pain, but the idea was to keep him in shape for future torture. Granite slabs were piled on his knees, each one weighing over a hundred pounds. By the time the fifth slab had been set, his flesh had turned red from the blockage of circulation. Froth stained the edges of his mouth and mucus ran from his nose. A sixth stone was placed, then a seventh.</p>
<p>“How about now? Had enough?”</p>
<p>The men pressed down heavily on the stones. A constable bent over him, listening expectantly, waiting for some indication that he was prepared to confess. In Tokugawa penal law, the criminal was the most crucial witness. Without a confession, no other proof would suffice to challenge his innocence. An eighth stone was added and Iemon began to vomit blood. The doctor raised his hand. The feet had turning black and the discoloration was rapidly spreading upward. He collapsed in a dead faint without a confession having been secured.</p>
<p>The severity of the examination reflected the seriousness of the case. Days passed. Iga no Kami consulted the physician as to the prisoner’s fitness. He feared the man might die before public retribution could be assured. When Iemon found himself once again before his judges, a gruesome lesson awaited him. A thief was being submitted to what was known as the “lobster torture.” He was propped up on a mat with his hands drawn up behind his shoulders and his feet tightly bound across his chest Properly conducted, this “persuasion technique” took place in the jail, but Iga no Kami wanted to see if it would have any effect on Iemon, knowing he knew he was next. The prisoner cast a quick glance in the direction of the man under torture and then hung his head down. His lips were twitching with apprehension. The judge’s words hit hard.</p>
<p>“Why deny the plain fact? Do you think the court is so ignorant of the comings and goings of a scamp like you? Kichitarō, or Kazuma the diviner, or whatever you called yourself, murdered Chōbei the flesh-peddler in the presence of witnesses.” </p>
<p>A constable positioned the transcribed testimony of the whores so that Iemon had no difficulty reading the title of the document.</p>
<p>“And why did you do it? Because you had made an agreement with Chōbei to sell the woman you dared to call your wife. And the proof? The seal of the Tamiya family on the bill of sale.” </p>
<p>At last Iemon looked up. The constable had set before him that fatal contract with Chōbei: a promise to hand over his wife upon receipt of the amount of five ryō. The paper had been recovered from Chōbei’s corpse. The flesh-peddler had wrapped it carefully in oiled paper and sewn it into the seam of his robe. Knowing Iemon’s past failure to honor services rendered, he was sure it might come in useful. Iemon was young and impatient; Chōbei was twice his age. That was the reality and the prisoner realized it.</p>
<p>Iemon’s eyes drifted from the paper to the thief under torture before him. The dark green hue of his body was changing rapidly. The doctor in attendance gave a warning sign to the judge. Skillfully the jailers cut loose the ropes and the body toppled over. Iemon observed the white, almost waxen, color of death. Medicine was administered and every attempt was made to revive the man, but to no avail. The expression on his face when they carried him off was so far from human that all but the most hardened onlookers shuddered. Iga no Kami broke the silence.</p>
<p>“Still not confessing?” </p>
<p>He gestured with his hand and Iemon knew what was coming next. He cried out at the top of his lungs that he had had enough. The law had triumphed. Iemon pressed a thumbprint to seal his confession to the nefarious deed. The magistrates rose and disappeared. They knew, and he knew, that it meant the death sentence.</p>
<p>Judgment was swift. The next day Honma Iga no Kami and Katada Tatewaki, in the presence of an official from the family of the Shōgun, pronounced sentence. Tamiya Yoemon and Kondō Rokurobei glared spitefully at the figure of Iemon squatting on the ground with his head hung low. The sword—that was his only remaining hope. </p>
<p>From his opening words, Iga no Kami made it clear that no mercy would be shown in this case. Suzuki the commoner was let off with a flogging and exiled from Edo. He was ordered to make restitution by renouncing everything he owned, whatever was left after paying the huge fines levied by the government. Tamiya Yoemon and Kondō Rokurobei were to forfeit their social class. In addition, the court was not disposed to close an eye to the crime of usury. Yoemon was to live out his days in destitution as a beggar and outcast. </p>
<p>For some years, the senile old man was hired along with Kondō’s former wife to sit at the Niōmon gate leading up to the great temple of the Asakusa Kannon to attract and amuse visitors on their way to pray. The woman was something of a shrew and it did not take long for her tongue to start lashing away at her Yoemon. By noon of the first day her abuse had led to blows and the bystanders had to step in to rescue the old man from a proper thrashing. This turned out to be beneficial to the temple. Far from an eyesore, they became an added attraction. The monks left it to the passersby to break up their squabbles. </p>
<p>Then one day old Tamiya Yoemon disappeared. Whether his corpse decorated some highway or was dumped into the swamp for the dogs to feed on is not known, but that was the end of him. Some months later the woman also stopped coming. Her abilities as a nag had attracted the attention of those qualified to judge such matters and she was transferred to a low-class brothel in the neighboring Yoshiwara to serve as the madam of the establishment.</p>
<p>Considering the punishment he rightly deserved, Kondō Rokurobei fared tolerably well. His confession had been a great help in cracking the case. He was not sentenced to ritual suicide but, to his great dismay, was banished in exile to the island of Sado. It was a savage place, subject to freezing Siberian winters and hellishly hot summers. There this once pampered gentleman was to live out his final days, few and miserable as they were. A man who had once idled away the hours drinking tea, playing go, arranging flowers, and relaxing in the cool of his garden at Yotsuyazaka now, at fifty years of age, had to struggle with a hard and dangerous life amidst the boorish fisherman into whose company he had been unceremoniously cast. It soon became clear that he was unsuited to the work and only got in the way, so he turned to handling administrative and clerical tasks as the need arose in the village. He was even provided with a wife. He was later afflicted with palsy and was no longer able to earn a living. At home, beatings took the place of dinner. The villagers laughed when they heard the old man had fallen off a cliff. Like the legendary brothers of Miss Nabe, they blamed their words for the mishap, and near a place called Negai erected a wooden shrine to placate the spirit of “Old man Rokurō.”</p>
<p>The day of execution had come. At his sentencing, Iemon had struggled against his bonds to move forward and plead for mercy and deliverance from the barbaric punishment prescribed for a traitor. The answer to his prayer was for him to be tied to a yoke and have his head hacked off slowly with a bamboo saw. If that failed, he was to be crucified. When the attendant stepped in to take him away, he was so terrified that their punching and kicking had little effect. He fought back with all his might as they approached the hallway where Iga no Kami was seated, but soon they had him back in jail. One of the constables turned to the others.</p>
<p>“Such antics won’t do him much good in the yoke.” </p>
<p>Everyone knew how the punishment worked and how notoriously unwilling the public was to participate. The practice had lapsed since the days of the third Shōgun and there was not much enthusiasm for Iemon’s case. He was placed under the yoke at the execution grounds in Shinagawa and a cut was made on each side of his neck. The saw, now smeared with blood, was placed atop the yoke at an inviting distance from the victim’s head. For five hours people passed, ogling curiously but with no motion to approach the condemned. Then a butcher from the outcast settlements sidled up to the yoke. The guards watched to see what he would do. He picked up the saw and took a pull. Iemon let out a yell, at which the man dropped the implement and ran away in a fright, much to the delight of the guards and bystanders. </p>
<p>Around one o’clock in the afternoon, a constable and his aid walked up and signalled to have the yoke removed. His limbs were numb and twitched uncontrollably as he was tied to a pole with two cross bars, on one of which his arms were stretched out and on the other, his legs. The double crucifix was raised upright. The hours passed in misery and the intensification of the torture only seemed to postpone death. When it looked as if he had fallen unconscious, he was fed vinegar to bring him back. His parched lips welcomed the fluid even though it would only prolong the agony. </p>
<p>With the arrival of spring, the days were getting longer. Finally, as the sun was about to set, the officer in charge gave the order and a constable stepped up to the foot of the cross. At his signal, one of the guards thrust his spear upward into Iemon’s gut. His limbs flinched instinctively. A guard on the opposite side took his turn with the spear. Others followed. For some time they continued with their sport, their reward for having stood so patiently on watch. The man was still not dead. Impatiently, the constable picked up a spear and plunged it violently upward until the tip was sticking up out of the man’s left shoulder. His head collapsed, limp, on his chest. Iemon was dead.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>These events did not escape the notice of the pious or the faint of heart. On the 3rd of April, 1717, an Inari shrine built to placate the spirit of the dreaded Lady of Tamiya was opened to the public with all due ceremony. It had been erected on the grounds of Matazaemon’s former residence, facing on Tera-machi and the narrow street that ran alongside Samon-chō to the east. It stood almost directly opposite the entrance to the Shōgan-ji temple. Over by the Samegabashi Bridge at the family temple, Myōgyō-ji, a gravestone and stele were erected.</p>
<p>In time, opposition began to mount against the monuments. It was said that the Lady Iwa still haunted the ward, inflicting pain and punishment on its inhabitants. As proof, attention was drawn to recent calamities like plague, pestilence, famine, and the levy of taxes. The shrine was said to be an invitation for her to settle in the area. The public neglected its upkeep and the paint on this once popular edifice began to fade and chip. Eventually, the opposition had their way and both the shrine and the grave were swiftly disposed of. </p>
<p>As it turned out, the fortunes of the ward did not improve without the protection of its tutelary Inari shrine. If anything, things got worse. It is not clear precisely when it was rebuilt, but by the late eighteenth century the shrine was very much alive and flourishing. It became a favored resort of samurai women seeking consolation from the illustrious Lady Tamiya for the infidelities or brutal treatment suffered at the hands of their husbands, and the strength to preserve their chastity. </p>
<p>In 1825 the actor Onoe Kikugorō III made Yotsuya famous with his presentation of the Yotsuya kaidan as written for the stage by Tsuruya Nanboku (Katsu Hyōzō). Around the beginning of the Meiji restoration Shunkintei Ryūō, the famous story-teller, spread its renown in the Shin Yoshiwara district where the tale of Iwa became a regular feature of the Konparu Festival. Her grave at Myōgyō-ji temple was restored. Since she had not been given the customary posthumous Buddhist name at death, the chief priest assigned her the title Tokushō-in Myōnen Nisshō Daishi or “Great teacher of proven virtue, wondrous mind, and shining light.”</p>
<p>I beg the reader not to judge my composition or its accuracy too harshly. The publisher of this reproduction of Ryuō’s story has made known the difficulties he faced in bringing it into print. When the manuscript reached him for evaluation, he recognized the power of the tale at once. But how was he to avoid incurring the wrath of the Yotsuya Inari? How escape punishment by the gods? He replied that he was ready to expose himself to these risks in order to present the work from appearing elsewhere in inferior and inaccurate form. He met the challenge with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>“Afraid? Not really, but then again, I am only human. I am interested in what is out of the ordinary, but I am not very excited about incurring divine wrath by publishing something that ought not be published. Still, even if the publication of the Yotsuya kaidan were to call down the punishment of the gods, how could I resist bringing enjoyment to the eyes and ears of the land? So let’s set the record straight in print and work with all haste to offset the unfounded stories in circulation. The truth can only benefit us. How could the gods be angered by that? They most certainly could not. Indeed, their protection is assured.” </p>
<p>The editor trusted in his argument, as do I.</p>
<p>Not infrequently one hears disparaging remarks about our shrines and temples. “Those dirty, shabby places,” they call them, “lacking in architecture and altogether uninteresting, no more than playgrounds for raggedy, snot-nosed children.” The men and ladies in their straw hats and parasols—sometimes whole herds of them—rush by these places with their noses in the air, letting drop a cockeyed word of ridicule as they strut past. My dear sir, my dear madam, you are passing history on the road. Here at the temple of Kōgon-ji, in its ramshackle guest hall, the great samurai Kusunoki Masashige and his devoted followers spoke their last words of defiance before disemboweling themselves. Do you think Kōbe is just somewhere to catch a ship without wasting too much time? Or how about the port less than a mile from the Tokyo-Yokohama railway? It is a living memorial to Nitta Yoshioki, who carved his protest in blood on the Ashikaga before killing himself in a treacherous trap set for him on this very spot. Over there, behind the Kōrai-ji temple near Ōiso, you will find a tiny, dilapidated shrine nestled at the foot of the cliff. This place you had better avoid. It is dedicated to the god of small-pox. </p>
<p>But the indifference and contempt shown these minor shrines neglects more than their history. The modest shrine of the Tamiya Inari embodies a vein of thought woven into the minds of these people you find so strange. Wandering through the entertainment district of one of our great cities, you will see a torii gate standing at the entrance in all its bright red grandeur. Within is a small shrine and a box for receiving offerings of goods or money. The main hall is decorated inside and outside with flags to mark a festival in progress. The scene has been set for a production of the Yotsuya kaidan. On stage, and even in moving pictures, the director and the actors carefully avoid upsetting the Iwa Inari, the fox bewitched by the spirit of Iwa. To this end, the sacred images and all the furnishings of veneration have been reproduced as they were at the original shrine. </p>
<p>Perhaps now you understand better the hesitation of the author and publisher to take on the story in its full form. And this is only one example of the vestiges of dark magic still to be found—and practised—in our country. If you walk along the beach at Kamakura, you may come upon the occasional straw amulet wrapped in a gaudy colored cloth and accompanied by a copper coin or some grains of rice. You will see them everywhere, from the crossroads of towns and villages to the bluffs of Yokohama. In times of epidemic, they are scattered around wayside shrines to the god of measles or other diseases as a warning to those who happen by. At other times, they can serve as a charm to cure one child by transferring its disease to another. This is done by rubbing the coin on the body of the suffering child and then discarding it. The dogs usually eat the rice that’s been left and the odious coin is often picked up by children playing in the area. The amulet itself goes into the trash the next time the garbage collectors make their rounds. The one thing that cannot be disposed of so easily, however, is the ignorance and ill will that such charms represent</p>
<p>With that, the Yotsuya kaidan and its ghastly tales of misfortune are brought to an end.</p>

<p>Kōdan is a genre of popular storytelling, performed solo and seated on a stage much the same as Rakugo. But while Rakugo tended to more comedic and aimed at ordinary people, Kōdan tended to deal with epic hero tales and appealed more to the nobility and higher classes.</p>
<p>The allusion is to Matsubayashi Hakuchi 松林伯知『怪談小松怨霊』[The Ghostly Tale of the Apparition of Komatsu] (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1901).</p>
<p>De Benneville, The Yotsuya Kwaidan, 7.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I have tried to analyze the scene of Iwa’s first apparition comparing Benneville’s translation with Ryūō’s text. See Saitō Takashi 斎藤 喬, “O-Iwa’s Curse: Apparitions and their After-Effects in the Yotsuya kaidan, Bulletin of the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture 42 (2018): 24–37.</p>
<p>The Kwaidan of the Lady of Tamiya: Samurai Tales of the Tokugawa (London: Routledge, 2001, 2010, 2016).</p>
<p>However, we do have a retranslation of de Benneville’s book back into Japanese. The translator, Osanai Kaoru 小山内 薫 (1881–1928), was a theater director and playwright of the Taishō period. Beginning in 1919, he serialized the novel in the daily newspaper 万朝報. The complete work was only published ninety years later as『お岩：小山内薫怪談集』[O-Iwa: Osanai Kaoru’s collected ghost stories] (Tokyo: Media Factory, 2009).</p>
<p>De Benneville’s transliteration of the Yotsuya zōtan.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I have tried to show the epistemological connection between the innocent bystanders in the story and the listening audience of the theater. See my「呪いの口伝え：春錦亭柳桜口演『四谷怪談』における巷説の表象」[The oral transmission of curses: The representation of rumors in Ryūō’s Yotsuya kaidan],『研究所報』[Research bulletin of the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture] 29 (2019): 20–31.</p>
